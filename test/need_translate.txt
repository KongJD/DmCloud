DMBP00000370	The characteristics are as described for the genus; a more complete description is given in Table BXII.c.232. Isolated from human clinical specimens, environmental samples, food, and water. Its clinical significance is not fully documented but its potential role as a pathogen is suggested by isolates from blood and similar specimens that are normally sterile. However, it may be colonizing rather than infecting nonsterile body sites. The isolates from food, drinking water, feces, and an intravenous fluid bottle suggest ways that humans come in contact with it. There is no evidence that it can cause diarrhea or intestinal infections. It should be considered a rarely isolated species of Enterobacteriaceae, and a possible opportunistic pathogen (extraintestinal infections only) for humans. The type strain was isolated from drinking water by Leclerc, 1962. The mol% G _x0003_ C of the DNA is: 52–55 (Tm). Type strain: 1783, ATCC 23216, CIP 82.92, DSM 5077, HAMBI 1696, JCM 1667, LMG 2803.

DMBP00000375	The description is based on information taken from Leifson (1962), Suzuki et al. (1999), and Evtushenko et al. (2000) unless indicated otherwise. Cells are irregular rods (generally 0.4–0.5 × 1.2–2.5 mm) in 2-d cultures, tending to form primary branching and V-arrangements. In older cultures, short rods and coccoid cells predominate and occur singly, in pairs, or sometimes in short chains or clumps. A distinct rod–coccoid cycle may be observed on some media. Motile by long peritrichous flagella (10 mm or more). Colonies are circular, somewhat convex, glossy, and opaque, with entire margin. The colony color is white to yellowish white in young culture, becoming pale yellow on R agar or deep yellow on CB agar with age due to production of a light-enhanced carotenoid pigment (Trutko et al., 2005). Obligatory aerobe. Catalase-positive; oxidase reaction is variable. Growth occurs at 7–37°C; optimum is ~26–30°C. Adonitol, cellobiose, dulcitol, d-fructose, d-galactose, d-glucose, glycerol, inositol, lactose, maltose, d-mannitol, d-mannose, melezitose, melibiose, l-rhamnose, salicin, l-sorbose, sucrose, trehalose, turanose, and d-xylose are used for growth as carbon sources on basal mineral medium (Shirling and Gottlieb, 1966) supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) yeast extract and 0.1% (w/v) casitone. d-Arabinose, d-fucose, inulin, lyxose, meso-erythritol, raffinose, ribose, and sorbitol are not used as carbon sources on the same medium. Acids are produced from d-arabinose, d-fructose, d-glucose d-galactose, d-mannose, sucrose, d-xylose, and sorbitol (weakly) but not from d-lactose, melibiose, d-raffinose, tagatose, inositol, and inulin. The acid production from some carbohydrates is rather weak and the test results vary with experiments (Evtushenko et al., 2000; Leifson, 1962; Suzuki et al., 1999; Yamada and Komagata, 1972b). Acetate, citrate, malate, and pyruvate are assimilated, but formate, succinate, oxalate, and tartrate are not. H 2S is produced from peptone. Nitrate is reduced to nitrite. DNA, Tween 40, and starch are hydrolyzed; casein, cellulose, gelatin, hypoxanthine, xanthine, tyrosine, Tween 60, Tween 80, and urea are not hydrolyzed or decomposed. Esculin is decomposed, but the test result may vary with the method used (Evtushenko et al., 2000; Funke et al., 1994; Suzuki et al., 1999). Methyl red and Voges–Proskauer tests are negative. The type strain tolerates up to 5% (w/v) NaCl and 0.02% (w/v) potassium tellurite. The data on utilization of various carbon sources with the Biolog test system are listed in Table 157. The major menaquinones are MK-11 and MK-10. Cellwall sugars include a predominant amount of rhamnose and minor amounts of fucose, mannose, glucose, and galactose. The principal polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and two characteristic glycolipids (glycosyldiacylglycerols) (Collins and Bradbury, 1986; Collins and Jones, 1980).

Colonies are small (less than 1.0 mm in diameter), smooth and grayish white. Dextran is not produced from sucrose. The amino acid requirements are complex. Lactose is fermented more readily than by other species and strains may acidify and even clot unsupplemented milk. Citrate may be dissimulated and acetoin and diacetyl formed (Cogan et al., 1981). Fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose, and sucrose are fermented. Amygdalin, arabinose, arbutin, cellobiose, mannitol, trehalose, and xylose are not fermented. Esculin is not hydrolyzed. Guanine, ade nine, xanthine, pyridoxal, and folic acid are not required for growth. Glucose litmus milk is acidified and curdled by some strains, albeit weakly. Gas production in litmus milk has not been described. Growth occurs in the presence of 3.0% (m/v) NaCl but not in the presence of 6.5% (m/v) NaCl. Growth occurs at pH 6.5 and 4.8. Heat resistance is higher than in other species and cells may survive 60 °C for 30 min. The species may not be widely distributed as recorded isolations are few and are mostly from dairy sources.

The DNA G+C content determined from the draft genome sequence is 67.9  mol%.Since the submission of this paper, it has been proposed that the genus Mycobacterium be split into an emended genus Mycobacterium and four novel genera based on analyses of comparative genomic data [61]. However, in an extensive genome-based classification of the phylum Actinobacteria, while the genus Mycobacterium appeared to be monophyletic and was not the most divergent genus within the order Corynebacteriales [62]. It will be interesting to see which of these two concepts of the genus Mycobacterium will prevail.

DMBP00000585	Bacillus circulans Jordan 1890, 821ALcir'cu.lans. L. part. adj. circulans circling.For many years this species accommodated a wide variety of phenotypically unrelated strains. It was referred to by Gibson and Topping (1938) as a complex rather than a species, and later investigators agreed with this description. Strains were frequently allocated to this species on account of their distinctive motile microcolonies (Figure 2i); however, Jordan named his isolate for the circular motion that he saw in the interior of colonies observed under low magnification, rather than because of motile microcolonies. Jordan's original strain is considered lost, but Ford's isolate 26, that he believed to be of the same species as Jordan's strain, is available. Smith and Clark (1938) observed the rotary motion within the colonies of Ford's strain and noted also the production of motile microcolonies. Despite a few discrepancies between Jordan's and Ford's descriptions of their strains, Smith et al. (1952) considered that Ford's strain 26 could be accepted as authentic and this became the type strain. The production of motile microcolonies is more characteristic of strains now allocated to Paenibacillus (see Further descriptive information, Colony characteristics, above).Further grounds for the allocation of later isolates to this species were the production of sporangia swollen by subterminal to terminal ellipsoidal spores, and their being very active in the production of acid from a very wide range of carbohydrates. DNA relatedness studies revealed at least 10 homology groups among strains labeled Bacillus circulans, and it became clear that the phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of the complex had resulted from the allocation of unrelated strains to the species (Nakamura and Swezey, 1983). This work led to the allocation of members of several of the homology groups to new or revived species which were subsequently assigned to Paenibacillus: Paenibacillus amylolyticus, Paenibacillus lautus, Paenibacillus pabuli and Paenibacillus validus. A further group of strains previously assigned to Bacillus circulans was proposed as the new species Bacillus (now Paenibacillus) glucanolyticus on the basis of a numerical taxonomic study (Alexander and Priest, 1989). However, many misnamed strains remain allocated to Bacillus circulans and await reallocation, and authentic strains of this species are in the minority in most collections.The description which follows is based upon the type strain and several other strains which have been shown by amplified rDNA restriction analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell proteins, and various phenotypic characters (De Vos, Logan and colleagues, unpublished data) to be closely related to the type strain. Phylogenetic studies indicate that Bacillus circulans, Bacillus firmus and Bacillus lentus are related.Facultatively anaerobic, motile, straight, round-ended, occasionally slightly tapered and curved rods 0.6–0.8 µm in diameter, appearing singly or in pairs and occasionally short chains.

The type strain conforms to the description given above.Most environmental isolates showed high Willcox probabilities and low standard errors of taxonomic distance for B. glucanolyticus (Table 3) when a probabilistic identification scheme was used (13). This indicates a close match between the characteristics of an isolate and the characteristics of the taxon. Indeed, from our experience, a Willcox probability greater than 0.99 coupled with a standard error of taxonomic distance less than 4.0 indicates that an isolate matches the taxon description in all but one or two characters (13; unpublished data). If we adopt our normal criterion of a Willcox probability greater than 0.950 coupled with a standard error of taxonomic distance less than 7.0 as proof of positive identification, then 7 of the 10 environmental isolates and all 4 of the original strains can be confidently assigned to B. glucanolyticus.

The following fatty acids are present in all strains: 14: 0, 16: 0, 17: 0 cyclo, 16: 1 2-OH, 16: 0 2-OH, 16: 0 3-OH, 18: 1 ω7c, 19: 0 cyclo ω8c, summed feature 2 (comprising 14: 0 3-OH, 16: 1 iso I, an unidentified fatty acid with an equivalent chain-length value of 10±928, or 12: 0 ALDE, or any combinations of these fatty acids) and summed feature 3 (comprising 16: 1 ω7c or 15 iso 2-OH or both). The G¬C content is 61.9–62.2 mol%. B. fungorum strains have been isolated from fungi, animals and human clinical samples. Several isolates of this species have been isolated from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. These bacteria appeared to be very closely associated with the fungus, and attempts to eliminate the bacteria were unsuccessful (SeigleMurandi et al., 1996). It has been suggested that there is a symbiotic relationship between the bacteria and the fungus, since the bacteria were very efficient degraders of the aromatic compounds derived from degradation of lignin by white-rot fungi (SeigleMurandi et al., 1996). Recently, several unidentified B. cepacia-like strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients were also classified as B. fungorum (our unpublished observations). The type strain, LMG 16225T (=CCUG 31961T), was isolated from the white-rot fungus P. chrysosporium. The type strain has the following additional characteristics: growth in O/F medium with fructose and xylose, on cetrimide and in the presence of 1.5% NaCl; assimilation ofL-arginine, DL-norleucine, L-arabinose, caprate and adipate; C4-esterase and cysteine arylamidase activity; G+¬C content of 62 mol%.

L. neut. adj. thermobutyricum referring to the production of butyrate under thermophilic conditions. Straight to slightly curved rods, 0.9–1.1 × 2.0–4.5 μm, occur singly, in pairs, or chains (up to 15 cells). Gramstain-positive cell-wall structure; Gram-negative staining reaction. Some very early exponential-phase cells may stain Gram-positive. Central to subterminal spores form at pH values below 6.2. Cells have 5–12 peritrichous flagella, but pronounced motility is not observed. The organism has an m-DPM-direct cell-wall type. Colonies in agar roll tubes are irregular, circular with lobate margins, and white to cream color. Colonies 3 weeks old turn brown, but do not contain a water-soluble pigment. Anaerobic, showing no growth in medium in which the resazurin is slightly pink. Yeast extract required for growth. Yeast extract cannot be replaced by tryptone, casein, or vitamin mixture. Moderate thermophile. Temperature range for growth is 26–61.5 °C with optimal growth at 55 °C. pH Range for growth is 5.8–9.0, with optimal growth at 6.8–7.1.824 FAMILY I. CLOSTRIDIACEAE Grows with yeast extract (0.3%) alone. The following substrates stimulate growth and result in a pH drop in the culture medium: d-glucose, d-fructose, maltose, d-xylose, d-ribose, cellobiose d-glucuronic acid, d-galacturonic acid, and pyruvate. Growth is not stimulated by d-arabinose, d-galactose, d-mannose, sucrose, xylitol, pectin, polygalacturonic acid, d-raffinose, starch, beech or birch hemicellulose, succinate, and fumarate (with or without formate, and malate). Growth is not stimulated by H2 plus CO2 , H2 plus S0 with or without CO2 ,0.3% (w/v) methanol, gelatin, or ethanol. The addition of 25 mM threonine, 25 mM valine, 25 mM phenylalanine, 25 mM leucine, or 25 mM isoleucine does not support, stimulate, or inhibit growth on medium containing 0.3% yeast extract and 0.25% (w/v) glucose. Fermentation of glucose produces butyrate, H2 , CO2 , and small amounts of acetate and lactate. API AN-IDENT strips give positive results for l-glucosidase and arginineaminopeptidase. Phosphatase reaction and gelatin hydrolysis give weak positive reactions. The following reactions are negative: ammonia production from arginine; casein hydrolysis; nitrate reduction; denitrification; indole production; N -acetylglucosaminidase; l-arabinosidase; β-glucosidase; l-fucosidase; l-galactosidase; β -galactosidase; pyroglutamic acid arylamidase; indoxyl acetate reaction; leucine, proline, tyrosine, alanine, histidine, phenylalanine, glycine aminopeptidases, and formate-plus fumarate utilization. Negative reactions for nitrate reduction, indole production, catalase, meat digestion, and denitrification. Clostridium thermobutyricum is not susceptible to cycloheximide, amphotericin B, actinomycin D, and novobiocin at concentrations of 100 μg/ml. Susceptible to erythromycin, tetracycline, neomycin sulfate (B + C mixture), polymyxin B sulfate, and metroimidazole at 5 μg/ml. Source: horse manure compost containing straw and wood shavings. DNA G+C content (mol%): 37 (Tm). Type strain: JW171K, ATCC 49875, DSM 4928. GenBank accession number (16S rRNA gene): X72868. Further comments: 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons show Clostridium thermobutyricum to fall within the radiation of cluster I of the clostridia as defined by Collins et al. (1994). The closest relative based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities is Clostridium thermopalmarium (98.5%). These two species differ in that Clostridium thermopalmarium produces ethanol from glucose fermentation and ferments sucrose; Clostridium thermobutyricum does not produce ethanol or ferment sucrose.伯杰氏手册

Gr. n.?diphthera?leather, skin; N.L. fem. n.?diphtheria?a disease in which a leathery membrane forms in the throat; N.L. gen. n.?diphtheriae?of diphtheria.(This description is largely based on that of Collins and Cummins,?1986.)Straight or slightly curved rods, frequently swollen at one or both ends, 0.3–0.8 × 1.0–8.0 ?m. Usually stains unevenly and often contains metachromatic granules (polymetaphosphate) which stain bluish purple with methylene blue. Gram-stain-positive, but easily decolorized, especially in older cultures.Descriptive cultural types or biovars (= biotypes) of?Corynebacterium diphtheriae?strains are still commonly applied and are designated gravis, intermedius, mitis, and belfanti. Designations for gravis, intermedius, and mitis were originally given in accordance with the clinical severity of cases from which the different strains were most frequently isolated. On blood agar, colonies vary in size and appearance but generally are 1–3 mm at 24 h (except intermedius, described below) and may demonstrate a narrow band of hemolysis, but no soluble hemolysin is produced. Colonies on blood tellurite (with 0.04% potassium tellurite) are gray to black, with appearance dependant on type. Colonies on modified Tinsdale agar are 1–2 mm, black or charcoal gray, with each colony having a brown-black halo visible in the agar as cysteinase produced by the organism reacts with the cysteine in the medium. Although less frequently used now, growth on Loeffler's medium is abundant, with grayish to cream colored colonies and no liquefaction. The use of historical descriptions of colonies (such as gravis being large, radially striated brittle colonies and mitis being smooth, shiny, and butyrous) or Gram stain details (gravis having short regular rods, intermedius with long rods with marked cross-striations, mitis with long curved irregular rods) as a means to subdivide strains into gravis, intermedius, and mitis are now rarely used.Biovars are usually reported for clinical isolates and are generally differentiated by phenotype: biovar gravis reduces nitrate and utilizes both glycogen and starch; biovar intermedius is somewhat lipophilic in that colonies are 0.5–1 mm after 24–48 h growth on blood agar, but otherwise reduces nitrate and may utilize glycogen (rapid strip API Coryne usually negative but conventional tube sugar positive) and starch; biovar mitis reduces nitrate but does not utilize glycogen and rarely starch; biovar belfanti neither reduces nitrate nor utilizes glycogen or starch. CAMP and CAMP inhibition reactions negative. All strains exhibit the same reactions except for occasional sucrose-fermenting isolates described primarily in South America (de Mattos-Guaraldi and Formiga,?1998) or?Corynebacterium diphtheriae?biovar belfanti like isolates that were derived from symptomatic cats and did not ferment maltose (Hall et al.,?2010). Optimal growth temperature 30–37°C, and complex media is required for growth.All?Corynebacterium diphtheriae?strains, regardless of biovar, conform to the genus description chemotaxonomically. All contain corynemycolates, the polar lipids phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and monoacylated phosphatidylinositol dimannoside, and MK-8 (H2) as major menaquinone. Cell wall contains?meso-diaminopimelic acid and the sugars arabinose and galactose. Straight-chain saturated fatty acids are mainly palmitic and stearic acids with minimal branched saturated fatty acids; significant quantities of C16:1?ω7c?isomer is characteristically detected (Bernard et al.,?1991). All produce propionic as a product of fermentation (Bernard et al.,?2002).Source: clinical specimens from humans or animals.DNA G+C content (mol%): 52–55 (method unknown); 53.48 (full genome sequencing).Type strain: ATCC 27010, CIP 100721, DSM 44123, NCTC 11397.Sequence accession no.

When grown in the presence of rich media (e.g. 20% fetal calf serum), colonies may demonstrate a coral-red to orange fluorescence when illuminated by a Wood's lamp (365 nm). A coralloid precipitin in agar is formed after growth on BHI agar supplemented with 1% Tween 80 whether in air or in CO2. No hemolysis on blood agar. Cells described as short, straight, or slightly curved rods (1–2 × 0.3–0.6 ?m) arranged at right angles to give V-formations. Metachromatic granules may be observed. Facultatively anaerobic. Optimal temperature 37°C. Positive for glucose, fructose, maltose, mannose, hippurate, alkaline phosphatase, pyrazinamidase, and leucine arylamidase.

Hippurate, sucrose, and mannose described as positive or variable but later as negative, positive, and negative, respectively. Acetoin positive, but indole negative; nitrate is not reduced, and urease is not produced. Tyrosine hydrolyzed (Funke and Bernard, 2007), but esculin and gelatin are not. Casein is not digested and methyl red is negative. Acid phosphatase, arginine dihydrolase, esterase, ester lipase, lipase, α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, α-mannosidase, α-fucosidase, naphthol-AS-BL-phosphoydrolase, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase, valine arylamidase, cystine arylamidase, trypsin, and chymotrypsin were negative.Cells contain meso-DAP with arabinose and galactose as cell-wall sugars. Menaquinones MK-8(H2) and MK-9(H2) are detected. Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, and unidentified glycolipids are found. Corynemycolates are present (De Briel et al., 1992). Cellular fatty acids are consistent with those of the genus, and tuberculostearic acid is detected (Bernard et al., 1991).

(16S rRNA gene): X82064, X84678, X84679.Further comments: additional GenBank accession numbers include (complete rpoB gene) AY492235. Accession number for NCTC 10288 X84678 was described by the depositor as Corynebacterium minutissimum clone 1 and NCTC 10288 X84679 as clone 2, respectively. By 16S rRNA gene sequencing, Corynebacterium minutissimum is closely related to (>98.9–99% identity) Corynebacterium aurimucosum and Corynebacterium singulare (Riegel et al., 1997b), but differs from these (?93.8–94.6% identity, respectively) when partial or complete sequences of the rpoB gene are compared (Khamis et al., 2004). Corynebacterium minutissimum had long been attributed as a cause of erythrasma, a skin infection, but this inference has been challenged, as most publications citing this association did so in the absence of laboratory-based evidence (Coyle and Lipsky, 1990). It has been thought that some published Corynebacterium minutissimum reports in the past may actually represent misidentified Corynebacterium amycolatum strains (Zinkernagel et al., 1996).来自伯杰氏手册

However, F. breve, unlike F. balustinum and the majority of F. meningosepticum strains, does not hydrolyze esculin and does not generally produce acid oxidatively from carbohydrates other than glucose and maltose. These characters distinguish F. breve from other recognized Flavobacterium species (3, 4). A study of the deoxyribonucleic acids of F. breve strains (6) showed that the species constitutes a relatively homogeneous taxon, all the strains of which are readily distinguishable from allied flavobacteria. The history of the species has been described elsewhere (4).The type strain of F. breve is NCTC 11099, and it has been described previously (4). The type strain is typical of the species both phenotypically and genotypically (4, 6) and was chosen for that reason.
DMBP00000983	Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. (as.ber'ry.i. N.L. gen. n. asburiae) is named in honor of Mary Alyce Fife-Asbury, an American bacteriologist who made many important contributions to the classification of Enterobacteriaceae, particularly in describing new Klebsiella and Salmonella serotypes (9, 10, 16), new genera, and new species (3, 11-13, 18). Strains of Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. are gram-negative, oxidase negative, nonmotile, fermentative, nonpigmented rods with the general characteristics of the family Enterobacteriaceae and of the genus Enterobacter (Table 5). They gave positive reactions in tests for methyl red, citrate utilization (Simmons and Christensen's), urea hydrolysis (may be delayed; see footnote to Table 5), L-ornithine décarboxylase (Moeller's), growth in KCN, hydrolysis of esculin, reduction of nitrate to nitrite, O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, acid and gas from the fermentation of D-glucose, and fermentation of L-arabinose, cellobiose, D-galactose, glycerol (delayed), lactose (may be delayed), D-mannitol, D-mannose, α-methyl -glucoside, salicin, D-sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and D-xylose. They gave negative reactions in tests for indole production, in the Voges-Proskauer test (see footnote to Table 5), in tests for H2S production, phenylalanine deaminase, L-lysine decarboxylase (Moeller's), gelatin hydrolysis, malonate utilization, lipase (corn oil), DNase, tyrosine clearing, and fermentation of adonitol, D-arabitol, dulcitol, erythritol, i(myo)-inositol, melibiose, and Lrhamnose. Variable reactions were obtained in tests for L-arginine dihydrolase (Moeller's), acid from mucate, L-tartrate fermentation (Jordan's), acetate utilization, and fermentation of raffinose.A number of biogroups were identified among Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. strains. Strains in these biogroups gave one or more of the following atypical test reactions: negative for urea hydrolysis, ornithine, growth in KCN, gas from glucose, fermentation of L-arabinose, D-mannitol, alpha-methyl-glucoside, raffinose, and D-xylose, and positive in the Voges-Proskauer test, tests for motility, and tests for utilization of malonate and fermentation of melibiose and L-rhamnose.Several Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. strains were received at the CDC as suspected Yersinia or Citrobacter species. Tests that differentiate Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. from species in these genera are shown in Table 6. Its positive methyl red test and negative Voges-Proskauer test and tests for motility, utilization of malonate, and fermentation of melibiose and L-rhamnose serve to differentiate Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. from all named Enterobacter species (Table 5). Tests of differential value in separating Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. from species of Enterobacteriaceae are described elsewhere (14, 15). All Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. strains were susceptible to gentamicin and sulfadiazine and resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, and penicillin. Variable susceptibility was seen to the other antimicrobial agents tested (Table 3).The sources of Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. strains and accompanying clinical information are given in Table 1. The strains came from 24 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Where the sex of the patient was identified, 27 of 50 isolates were from males. Where age was given, 24% of strains were isolated from people aged O to 2 years, 26% of strains were isolated from people aged 16 to 44 years, and 50% of strains were isolated from people aged 59 to 90 years. Sixteen of the strains were from urine, 15 were from respiratory sources, 12 were from stools, 11 were from wounds or exudates, 7 were from blood, and 1 each was from the endometrium, gall bladder, lochia, penis, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, and environment. Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. is widely distributed geographically in the United States and is frequently encountered, at least with respect to the more recently described species of Enterobacteriaceae (14, 15). Its presence in seven blood cultures (mentioned above) at least suggests clinical significance. When isolated from other sources, however, its clinical significance is uncertain and requires further study.The type strain of Enterobacter asburiae sp. nov. is 1497-78 (=ATCC 35953). It was isolated from a lochia exudate from a 22-year-old woman in R.I. Its biochemical characteristics are those of the species as shown in Table 3. The G+C content of its DNA is 55 ± 1.1 mol%.

DMBP00001288	LSPN The phenotypic properties of strains 715-719 (Table 1) as well as those of strains representative of all of the species of Vibrio and Photobacterium listed by Baumann et al. [7] were submitted to a numerical analysis. The results (not shown) indicated that these isolates were distinct and differed from the species of these two genera by 9-32 phenotypic properties. Four additional species of Vibrio have recently been described [13,16,17,20]. Although characterized by a different and somewhat more limited methodology than the one used in our studies, the results, nevertheless, clearly indicate that the species are phenotypically distinct from V. orientalis. An electron microscopic examination of strain 717, grown on liquid or solid medium, revealed the presence of a single, sheathed polar flagellum (Fig. 2). The G+C contents of the DNA of strain 715, 717, and 719 were 45.8, 45.4, and 45.3 moles %, respectively. All of these results indicate that the cluster consisting of strains 715-719 was a new species of Vibrio, which we have designated as V. orientalis sp. nov. (L. adj. orientalis, of or belonging to the Orient). Strain 717 has been designated as the type strain and deposited in the American Type Culture Collection as ATCC 33934. V. orientalis is the only described luminous species of Vibrio that is able to accumulate poly-/3- hydroxybutyrate as an intracellular reserve product and to utilize DL-/3-hydroxybutyrate, putrescine, and spermine as sole or principal sources of carbon and energy. Additional diagnostic traits are the presence of an amylase, an arginine dihydrolase system, growth at 4~ but not at 40~ and the ability to utilize sucrose and cellobiose but not glucuronate, a-ketoglutarate, and y-aminobutyrate as sole or principal sources of carbon and energy. This combination of properties distinguishes V. orientalis from species of Vibrio and Photobacterium by 6-I0 traits. Using the antiserum to the SOD from V. alginolyticus 90, V. splendidus biotype II 2, V. fischeri 61, and V. cholerae M13 [1], we have determined the ImDs of strains 715, 716, and 717. The combined results for all three strains (expressed as the mean _+ standard deviation) are 6.4 _+ 0.1, 23.5 +_ 0.2, 26.0 -+ 0.8, and 59 _+ 0.4 ImD units, respectively. A three-dimensional representation of the results, which includes only those species and strains of Vibrio with an SOD similar to the enzyme from V. orientalis, is presented in Fig. 3. (This figure is a portion of the larger Fig. 3 in reference [1], which includes many additional strains of Vibrio.) On the basis of its SOD, V. orientalis is related to the relatively large group of primarily marine species of Vibrio, which includes such common species as V. harveyi, V. alginolyticus, and V. paraHaemolyticus. Its nearest neighbor is strain 77; both V. orientalis and strain 77 have an arginine dihydrolase system.

DMBP00001352	LPSNIt is our opinion that C. autotrophicum belongs to a new genus of the family Azotobacteraceae, for which we propose the name Xantho- bacter (Xan.tho.bac’ter. Gr. adj. xanthos yellow; M.L. masc. n. bacter the equivalent of Gr. neut. n. bacterion rod, staff; M.L. masc. n. Xantho- bacter yellow rod). The name of this organism thus becomes Xanthobacter autotrophicus(Baumgarten, Reh, and Schlegel 1974) comb, nov.The description of Xanthobacter gen. nov. is as follows. Small, rod-shaped cells 0.4 to 1.0 by 0.8 to 6.0 μm; branched, rather pleomorphic cells are produced on succinate-containing medium, and coccoid as well as cells up to 10 μιη long are produced on media containing an alcohol as the sole carbon source. Refractile (polyphosphate) and lipid (poly-β-hydroxybutyrate) bodies are contained within the whole cell.Nonmotile. Resting stages are unknown. Gram-negative type of cell wall, but the Gram reaction is variable; the cell wall contains pep- tidoglycan directly linked by m-diaminopimelic acid; hpopolysaccharides are present in the cell wall but teichoic and teichuronic acids are absent. Agar colonies are opaque and slimy; slime- free strains also exist. Colonies are yellow due to a water-insoluble carotenoid pigment, zeaxan- thin dirhamnoside.Grow as chemolithoautotrophs in mineral medium under an atmosphere of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide (7:2:1 by volume) as well as chemoorganotrophically on methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, and many organic acids used as sole carbon sources; carbohydrate utilization is limited. Neither acid nor gas is produced from carbohydrates.Atmospheric nitrogen is fixed in nitrogen-deficient media under reduced oxygen pressure with an efficiency of more than 10 and usually 20 mg of N per g of sucrose consumed.Obligately aerobic. Catalase positive.Optimal growth temperature: 25 to 30°C. pH range for optimal growth: 5.8 to 9.0.Guanine-plus-cytosine content of the deoxyribonucleic acid: 69 to 70 mol%.Isolated from soil, mud, and water.Type species: Xanthobacter autotrophicus(Baumgarten, Reh, and Schlegel 1974) comb, nov.The new taxonomic position of C. autotrophi- cum, as determined by the keys in Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (6), does not suggest a systematic or evolutionary relationship to the other genera of the family Azo- tobacteraceae. The ribosomal ribonucleic acid homology might be taken as a criterion of the natural relationships between strains. The ribosomal ribonucleic acid properties of our strains were studied by J. DeLey (personal communication). They are far from those of Azotobacter and Derxia and closest to, but still quite different from, those of Beijerinckia. The Azotobac- teraceae themselves, however, are heterogeneous with respect to ribosomal ribonucleic acid homology. Therefore, the ribosomal ribonucleic acid property of X. autotrophicus is not considered as justification for excluding this species from this physiologically homogeneous family.No taxonomic relationship of X autotrophicus to members of Xanthomonas, Flavobacter- ium, Chromobacterium, Cytophaga, the Meth- ylomonadaceae, or other taxa of questionable taxonomic position was found with respect to such characteristic properties as irregular cell shape, colony pigmentation, slime production, guanine-plus-cytosine content, Gram variability, nitrogen fixation, autotrophic growth, methanol utilization, and limited pattern of carbohydrate utilization.
DMBP00001353	LPSNXanthobacter Flavus sp. nov At present, only one strain of this species is known, i.e., the type strain. Consequently, the following serves as the description of both the species and the type strain.Cells are rod shaped and measure 0.5 to 0.7 by 1.0 to 2.5 µm; irregularly branched cells occur on media containing organic acids. Typically the cells have swollen ends; there is a tendency to filament formation. Gram variable. Nonmotile. Endospores are not produced. The cell walls do not contain arabinogalactan or mycolic acids.Agar colonies are pale yellow or creamy, opaque, slimy, circular, entire, and convex.Chemoorganotrophic and facultatively chemolithotrophic.Atmospheric nitrogen is fixed in nitrogen-deficient media.Aerobic but microaerophilic under chemolithotrophic conditions and while fixing molecular nitrogen.Requires B12, biotin, or riboflavin.Many types of organic acids can be utilized. Many carbohydrates are also utilized, but most of these only after prolonged incubation.Temperature for optimal growth: about 30° C.G+C content of the DNA: 69 mol%.Other major characters are listed in Tables 1 and 3Type strain: strain 301 (= DSM 338 = NCIB 10071).

Fresh cultures often demonstrate a bipolar Gram staining. Pleomorphic rods and short filaments can be seen in broth cultures and older cultures. Many strains produce capsules. For isolation, blood containing agar such as sheep blood or chocolate agar is preferred. Colonies reach a diameter of 1–2 mm after 24 h at 37℃, demonstrating a light grayish color without hemolysis. Mucoid, smooth, and rough colonies might be observed in addition to small colony variants. The optimal growth temperature for avian strains might be as high as 42℃, compared to 36℃ for mammalian strains. Growth can be observed in a wide mesophilic range from 25 to 42℃. The indole-producing strains exhibit a distinct odor. Isolates of P. avium biovar 2 and P. canis biovar 2 associated with pneumonia in cattle have been reclassified with P. multocida based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons and other characteristics (Christensen et al., 2004). Strains formerly classified as biovar 2 of P. canis are indole-negative. The reference strain for biovar 2 of P. canis is CCUG 16498(Bisgaard’s ornithine-positive taxon 13). In addition, taxon 13 of Bisgaard has been classified with P. multocida (Madsenet al., 1985).In addition to the features common to all members of the genus (Circumscription of the genus), ornithine is decarboxylated, and acid is produced from (?)-D-mannitol.Usually there is no V-factor requirement, but exceptionally V-factor-requiring strains may occur (Krause et al., 1987).The phenotypic characteristics separating P. multocida from other species of Pasteurella sensu stricto are presented in Table 1. Major differences in the phenotypical characteristics have been reported for P. multocida (Biberstein et al., 1991;Bisgaard et al., 1991b, 2013; Fegan et al., 1995; Heddleston,1976).P. multocida was subdivided into three subspecies: subsp. multocida, subsp. septica, and subsp. gallicida according toDNA-binding data and differences in acid production fromsorbitol and dulcitol. A 1.2–2.0% 16S rRNA sequence variation was found between P. multocida subsp. septica and P. multocida subsp. multocida and gallicida, while subsp. multocida and gallicida were nearly identical (Kuhnert et al., 2000;Petersen et al., 2001; Davies, 2004; Bisgaard et al., 2013).Several typing systems have been developed and appliedfor epidemiological studies of P. multocida (Blackall and Miflin, 2000; Blackall et al., 1999, 2000; Nielsen and Rosdahl,1990; Christensen et al., 2020). The population structure ofP. multocida has found clonal as determined by multlocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) (Blackall et al., 1998; Mayet al., 2001). Two multilocus sequencing typing systems have been developed for P. multocida (Davies et al., 2004 [multispecies]; Subaaharan et al., 2010 [RIRDC]). The diversit of P. multocida has been investigated by the RIRDC MLST(Bisgaard et al., 2013).Isolates of the species have been obtained from most mammals, including humans and from birds in which a widerange of diseases are reported due to P. multocida.Identification of P. multocida to the species level can be done by the PCR of Townsend et al. (1998). A comparisonof PCR species specific tests was published by Adhikary et al.(2013). A qPCR for the specific detection of P. multocida based on the sodA gene was described by Tocqueville et al. (2017).DNA G+C content (mol%) (whole- genomicsequencing):39.70–40.50.Type strain: NCTC 10322, ATCC 43137.Genome size (whole-genomic sequence): 2.08–2.54 Mb.

E. gergoviae is 7 to 15% related to Hafnia, Yersinia, and protei, and 20 to 30% related to other genera.E. gergoviae is distinct both biochemically and genetically from the presently described species of Enterobacteriaceae. The G+C value of 60 mol% is compatible with findings for species of Serratia, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. E. gergoviae is closest genetically to Enterobacter and Klebsiella. Biochemically it is closest to Enterobacter on the basis of its motility and positive reaction for ornithine decarboxylase.The name Enterobacter gergoviae sp. nov. is proposed for this organism. The specific epithet gergoviae indicates that the type strain was isolated from samples taken during a urinary infection outbreak in Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital near Gergovie Highland in France.

Some 80 sporadic isolates have been identified in our laboratories since 1976, and the organism has been implicated in a nosocomial outbreak of urinary tract disease (8). This already relatively large number of isolates will undoubtedly increase as laboratories become familiar with the characteristics of E. gergoviae.

DMBP00001461	bre’vis. L. fem. adj. brevis short.The morphological and biochemical characteristics of this species are based on those of Bryant et al. (1958) and Holdeman et al.

The species was originally part of a heterogeneous collection of strains that were assigned to Bacteroides ruminicola as Bacteroides ruminicola subspecies brevis (biovars 1 and 2). Even though DNA–DNA hybridization values (Shah et al., 1982) [see Holdeman et al.(1984)] between the various subspecies of Bacteroides ruminicola indicated they were distinct species, their taxonomic status remained unchanged because of the lack of reliable phenotypic characters for delineating each subspecies. They were reassigned to the genus Prevotella (Shah and Collins,1990) and elevated to species rank (along with Prevotella ruminicola subsp. ruminicola and Prevotella ruminicola subsp.brevis (biovar 3) now Prevotella bryantii) by Avgu?tin et al.(1997).

It was delineated from among the Bacteroides oralis-Bacteroides ruminicola complex using long-chain cellular fatty acid and menaquinone profiles (Shah and Collins, 1980), DNA–DNA hybridization(Shah et al., 1982) and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis(Shah and Williams, 1982). The description is based on these papers and Johnson and Holdeman (1985).Cells occur in pairs or short chains, are rod-shaped and are 0.5–0.6 × 0.8–6.5 μm in PYG or BM broth cultures. Cells on brain heart infusion agar (BHIA) roll tubes (Holdeman et al., 1980) produce subsurface colonies 1–2 mm in diameter, lenticular and translucent. Colonies grown on blood agar plates are 0.5–3 mm in diameter, circular with an entire edge, low convex, translucent to semi-opaque, white or buff,shiny, smooth and nonhemolytic on rabbit blood. There is no action on rabbit blood or egg yolk agar (Holdeman et al., 1977). Most cells do not grow in PYG containing 10% bile; cells that do grow are markedly inhibited and delayed.Growth is stimulated by heme and for some strains this is an absolute requirement for cytochrome biosynthesis.Pre-reduced broth cultures after incubation at 37?C for 24 h are uniformly turbid with a smooth sediment; the terminal pH after 3–5 d is 4.5–5.0 in broths with carbohydrates or 5.1–5.6 in the absence of sugars.Cells typically ferment the pentose sugars arabinose and xylose, in addition to cellobiose, dextrin, fructose, glucose,glycogen, lactose, maltose, mannose, melibiose, raffinose,salicin, starch and sucrose. Acid is not produced from melezitose, trehalose, inositol or mannitol. Nitrate is not reduced; indole and catalase are not produced. Gelatin is digested by most strains.Succinic and acetic acids are the major fermentation end products from glucose broth, with minor amounts of formic, isobutyric and isovaleric acids; no H2 is produced.The long-chain fatty acid composition is mainly anteiso- and iso-methyl branched acids, with lower levels of straight-chain acids. The major fatty acid is 12-methyltetradecanoic acidC15:0 anteiso). The principal respiratory quinones are unsaturated menaquinones with 13, 12 and 11 isoprene units.Source: type strain was isolated from gingival crevice with moderate periodontitis.

Cells are obligately anaerobic, non-motile, pigmented Gram-negative bacilli (0.7×0.9–3.0 µm). After 4 days of incubation on FAA plates, colonies are 2–3 mm in diameter, circular, entire, convex, smooth, opaque and off-white, with a light orange pigment in the centre of the colonies. On further incubation, colonies develop a distinct area of dark brown pigment in the centre of the colony to form a ‘bullseye’ colony.

DMBP00001519	Gram-negative rods, 0.7 to 0.9 pm in diameter (mean values) by phase-contrast microscopy. Strain XII has a mean cell diameter slightly larger than that of strains X and XI (0.88 pm compared to 0.76 µm). Length: approximately 5 to 10 pm, but old cultures may contain cells up to 42 µm in length. Possess flagella in bipolar fascicles which are easily seen by dark-field or phase-contrast microscopy and which exhibit an extended form with helical wave propagation; the fascicles retract by coiling into a polar loop or by bending at the base, frequently with coiling around the cell. Cells contain prominent poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules. All strains grow well in PFS broth, but strain XII grows more slowly than the others. Growth occurs in viscous floes upon initial isolation; this property may be lost upon continued transfer. Cells move in straight lines within the floes, especially when cultured in 0.1 × PFS broth. Cells at the periphery of the floes, and free cells, move in irregular, circular paths if motile at all. Cells from homogeneous cultures swim best in highly viscous media. The optimal viscosity of methyl-cellulose “400 cp” for the motility of strain XI is approximately 200 cp, whereas that for strains X and XII is approximately 10 cp. Maximal motility is exhibited by cells cultured for 8 h in PFS broth prior to being suspended in methylcellulose medium.

DMBP00001530	"A description of the species follows. P. penneri has the general characteristics of the genus Proteus, which are as follows: positive tests for urea hydrolysis, phenylalanine deaminase, gelatin hydrolysis, H2S production, and tyrosine clearing; swarming on blood agar; a negative test for D-mannose fermentation; and resistance to colistin. The following tests are positive for most P. penneri strains: methyl red; motility; growth in the presence of KCN; and fermentation of D-galactose, maltose, sucrose, and D-xylose. The following tests are negative for all or most P.penneri strains: indole production; Voges-Proskauer; lysine and ornithine decarboxylase (Mollers); arginine dihydrolase (Mallers); malonate utilization; fermentation of adonitol, Larabinose, D-arabitol, cellobiose, dulcitol, erythritol, i-(myo)-inositol, lactose, melibiose, raffinose, L-rhamnose, salicin, D-sorbitol, and mucate; esculin hydrolysis; and acetate utilization. The proposed type strain is CDC 1808-73 (ATCC 33519). The G+C content of this strain is 38 mol%. A more detailed description of the new species is given in Tables 2, 3, and 4.The P. penneri strains were resistant to chloramphenicol by both agar diffusion and broth dilution methods. We suspect that this resistance is intrinsic rather than plasmid-mediated because some of our strains were isolated in the 1960s and have been stored over a long period of time, yet all of them have remained resistant.The biogroup 2 strains were all sensitive to chloramphenicol; however, preliminary data on biogroup 3 suggest that it may contain both sensitive and resistant strains. von Graevenitz and Nourbakhsh (15) reported that 14% of 66 indole* strains of P. vulgaris were resistant to chloramphenicol. Perhaps these strains belong in biogroup It now appears that the indole reaction, along with the reactions for salicin and esculin, sepa""rate what was previously known as P. vulgaris into three groups. In this study we have shown that the indole"", salicin"", esculin"", chloram phenicol-resistant group is a separate species.Our study and a previous study (3) indicate that the biogroup 2 strains also represent a separate species. Biogroup 3 is currently the group that should be designated P. vulgaris since the type strain belongs to this group. We are currently collecting strains in this group so that a full study can be conducted. This study must be completed before a logical classification can be proposed for biogroups 2 and 3, which are still classified asP. vulgaris. Table 7 gives a summary of our current classification of the genus Proteus and the tests that are useful for differentiation.The clinical significance of P. penneri is unknown. There was one blood isolate, but no other clinical information was available for this strain. Perhaps this report will stimulate others to look for this organism and help define its ecology and role in human disease. Clinical laboratories should suspect P. penneri for a Proteus strain that is indole"" and has a small zone around chloramphenicol but otherwise resembles P. vulgaris. Salicin"", esculin"", ornithine decarboxylase negative, and maltose positive reactions would differentiate it from P.vulgaris and P. mirabilis. "

Like members of other species of Providencia, strains of Providencia heimbachae (particularly fresh isolates) develop a red to brown pigment on media containing aromatic amino acids, as well as a characteristic almondlike smell on phenylalanine agar (17). Furthermore, they have the other characteristics of this genus (Table 3). They are negative for the following tests: lysine and ornithine decarboxylases, arginine dihydrolase, deoxyribonuclease, lipase (both corn oil and Tween 80), gelatinase, H2S production on Kligler and triple sugar iron agars, malonate, mucate, acetate, tartrate, pectate, o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, Voges-Proskauer, and acid production from l-arabinose, cellobiose, dulcitol, d-lactose, melibiose, α-methyl-glucoside, raffinose, and d-sorbitol. They are positive for the following tests: acid production from d-mannose, methylred, phenylalanine deaminase, and tyrosine clearing. Providencia heimbachae can be differentiated from other Providencia species by its negative tests for Simmons citrate, growth in the presence of KCN, acid production from trehalose, urease, and indole production and by positive tests for acid production from adonitol, d-arabitol, d-galactose, and l-rhamnose (Table 5). Motility at 36°C is variable and weak (46% positive after 2 days; 85% positive after 3 to 7 days), and the gas produced in small amounts from d-glucose, d-galactose, and d-mannose by some strains is like that produced by Providencia rustigianii (often a pinhead-sized gas bubble in a Durham tube). Additional characteristics of Providencia heimbachae are given in Tables 3 through 5.Some biochemical tests give different results when medium ingredients or methods are varied. The indole reaction is negative when bacteriological neutralized peptone (Oxoid USA), Polypeptone (BBL), or casein hydrolysate (E. Merck AG, Darmstadt, Federal Republic of Germany) is used; however, it is weakly positive after 2 to 7 days when tryptone (Oxoid USA) or peptone is used along with 0.1% tryptophan (2). The citrate reaction is negative only under standardized conditions (4). Traces of readily metabolized substances, such as peptone or glucose, may lead to falsepositive results. The KCN test is negative under standardized conditions, as described previously (5); however, weak positive results are obtained if the test is performed as described by Cowan (3) or Munson (13).The similar biochemical reactions of Providencia heimbachae and Providencia rustigianii, including weak or delayed motility, weak or no production of gas from sugars, and inability to utilize acetate, citrate, or tartrate, indicate that these two species are phenotypically more similar to each other than to the other three species of Providencia. The similarity between Providencia heimbachae and Providencia rustigianii may in part reflect the the common habitat of the two species (i.e., the intestines of healthy penguins [12] and probably also other animals).The type (holotype) strain of Providencia heimbachae is strain MU A 2-110 (= CDC 8025-83 = ATCC 35613). This strain was isolated from the feces of a penguin (Aptenodytes patagonica) in a West German zoo by F. Heimbach. Its phenotypic characteristics (Table 3) are essentially those of the species.doi:

DMBP00001564	ae.ru.gi.no’sa. L. fem. adj. aeruginosa full of copper rust or verdigris, hence green.Characteristics of the species are summarized in Tables 1,5, 6, and 7. Rods, motile by means of a single polar flagellum.Two main colony types can be observed on common solid media. One is large, smooth, with flat edges and elevated center (“fried egg” appearance), and the other is small, rough,convex. On the large colonies, silver-gray metallic shining patches may be observed, and pitting is fairly common. Clinical materials are, in general, good sources of the large colony type, whereas the small type is commonly obtained from natural sources (Véron and Berche, 1976). Variation of the large type to the small is rather common but the reverse variation is extremely rare. A third colony type (mucoid) often can be obtained from respiratory and urinary tract secretions and was first observed by Sonnenshein (1927). Mucoid mutants can be divided into two groups according to the capacity of forming mucus (alginate) in chemically defined media (Fyfe and Govan, 1980). Aside from pyoverdine and pyocyanin,other pigments may be produced by some strains, including a dark red pigment (see above section on pigments).Denitrification and gelatin liquefaction is present in thegreat majority of strains. The hydrolysis of Tween 80 is weak and the egg-yolk reaction is negative. Optimum temperature,37?C. P. aeruginosa is probably the most widespread of all bacterial species. It can be isolated from soil and water, particularly from enrichment cultures for denitrifying bacteria. Commonly isolated from clinical specimens (wound, burn, and urinary tract infections). Causative agent of “blue pus”, which accounts for the origin of the synonym pyocyaneus. Occasionally pathogenic for plants. Strains isolated from leaf spot of tobacco, identical with or similar to P. aeruginosa have been named “P. polycolor” (Clara, 1930). The species can be internally divided into a number of subgroups (types) useful for epidemiological purposes.The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 67.2 (Bd).Type strain: ATCC 10145, DSM 50071, NCIB 8395, NCTC 10332.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA): X06684, Z76651.

Acetate, benzoate, citrate, formate, fumarate, gluconate, lactate, propionate, and succinate are utilized. Galacturonate, oxalate, and tartrate are not. Oxidase and catalase reactions positive; nitrate reduction, pectate liquefaction, starch hydrolysis, esculin hydrolysis, levan production, and growth factor requirements are all negative. Further extensive phenotypic studies on strains of this species in comparison with other fluorescent organisms have been published (Fahy, 1981). Some of the reported properties are summarized in Table 8. Details of its fatty acid composition are known (Stead, 1992). The organism causes drippy gill of mushrooms, and one of the main differences with another mushroom pathogen, P. tolaasii, is in the utilization of benzoate.

DMBP00001608	Pseudomonas carboxydohydrogena (Sanjieva and Zavarzin) comb. nov., a Monotrichous, Nonbudding, Strictly Aerobic, Carbon Monoxide-Utilizing Hydrogen Bacterium Previously Assigned to Seliberia | Microbiology Societydoi:Cells of Seliberia carboxydohydrogena DSM 1083 were found to be gram-negative, colorless, motile, and catalase and oxidase positive. Starch, urea, exogenous poly-<beta>-hydroxybutyric acid, agar, and Tween 80 were not hydrolyzed. The bacterium was avirulent for Lycopersicon escu- lentum and was 3-ketolactose-negative whereas the control organism, Agrobacterium tumefaciens 3/3-3, showed tumor formation as well as 3-ketolactose production. Neither meta-hydrox- ybenzoate nor pantothenate was used as a sole source of carbon. In stab cultures supplemented with nutrient broth-yeast extract, glucose, or fructose, growth of S. carboxydohydrogena DSM 1083 occurred exclusively on the agar surface, indicating that growth was strictly dependent on the presence of oxygen.The substrate utilization spectrum of S. carboxydohydrogena DSM 1083 was restricted. Only acetate, pyruvate, lactate, citrate, fuma- rate, malate, and aspartate were used as sole sources of carbon and energy for heterotrophic growth. With the exception of fructose, sucrose, and aspartate, carbohydrates and amino acids, as well as m-hydroxybenzoate and pantothenate, were not utilized. The cells were able to grow autotrophically in a mineral medium under an atmosphere of 40% CO, 10% O2, and 50% N2 at a doubling time (td) of 20 h (30°C) as well as under an atmosphere of 80% H2, 10% 02, and 10% CO2 (td = 7 h). The enzyme system for carbon monoxide utilization was soluble and was formed only during growth with CO; hydrogen- ase was membrane bound and was present in cells grown with CO or with H2 + C02.

DMBP00001616	chlo.ro.ra’phis. Gr. adj.chlorus green; Gr. n. raphis a needle; M.L.fem. n. chlororaphis a green needle.Fluorescent pigment is produced. Even though thespecies name refers to the production of the green insolublephenazine pigment chlororaphin, which often is excretedand crystallizes around the colonies, P. chlororaphis has beenfound to be closely related to P. aureofaciens Kluyver (whichdoes not produce this pigment, but instead makes anotherphenazine pigment that is orange and freely diffuses intothe medium. The relationship between the two species wasdemonstrated by a high DNA similarity as determined byDNA–DNA hybridization (Palleroni et al., 1972; Johnson andPalleroni, 1989). For this reason, P. chlororaphis may includetwo subspecies: subsp. chlororaphis, producing chlororaphin,and subsp. aureofaciens, which produces the water-solublephenazine monocarboxylic acid. Other phenotypic properties that differentiate the two subspecies are the utilizationof L-arabinose and α-amylamine by subsp. aureofaciens, andof D-alanine by subsp. chlororaphis. Optimum temperature,about 30?C. The type strain of P. chlororaphis subsp. chlororaphis was isolated from dead larvae of the cockchafer (alarge European beetle).

DMBP00001626	A preliminary examination of TPNP isolates indicated that they most resemble P. cepuciuBurkholder (1950) emend. Ballard et ul. 1970, and P. murginutu (McCulloch) Stapp, 1928emend. Ballard et al. 1970 (syn. P. ulliicolu (Burkh.) Starr & Burkholder 1942). All were Gramnegative, non-sporing rods, motile by means of multitrichous polar flagella, which accumulatedpoly-/%hydroxybutyrate as intracellular storage granules. On NA, colonies after 2 days werecream to buff, round, raised with a slightly irregular surface and slightly undulate margins,translucent, butyrous, shining and 1-1.5 mm diameter; after 6 days colonies darkened to yellowto fawn, and were 1-3 mm diameter. On NDA, after 2 days colonies were yellowish, often withgreen centres and produced yellow to yellow-green, diffusible pigment; they were raised, lowdomed or slightly umbonate usually with wrinkled centres or margins, round, undulate,translucent to semi-translucent, butyrous, shining as isolated colonies but semi-matt in the washout streak, and 0-5-1-0 mm diameter. After 6 days on NDA the colonies were creamyellow to khaki and some retained the &reen aondifbible pigment but in many it had faded ordisappeared; they had become less transhcent., more wrinkl%d (only one isolate was smooth),often had matt or pitted surfaces and were 1-3 mm in dkneter (Pl. 2, figs 8-11). On KAcohnies were initially similar to those on NA but &r 6 days they were deep fawn in colour. OnKB a diffusible yellow-green pigment was pmduced which did not fluoresce under U.V. light; noditrusible pigment, or a yellow-green CtiaLSitsle pigmertt that appeared at 1 day and then faded,was produced on KA. Morphdt-tgkal colony clnirpcters of the cultures of P. cepaciu and P.alliicola examined were similar to, but distinct from, those of TPNP isolates. P. cepaciaproduced yellow diffusible pigment on KA and to a lesser extent on NA, and P. alliicoluproduced a similar pigment on KA; TPNP isolates produced no such pigment on NA and no, orweak, fugitive pigment on KA. Until 1976, isolates that did not produce diffusible pigment onNDA and produced only weak fugitive pigment on KB were obtained from tomatoes withtomato pith necrosis symptoms only occasionally. These isolates could not be distinguished bythe differential characters given in Table 2 from the 17 isolates on which the description of TPNP given here is based. In 1976 and 1977 most of the isolates obtained did not produce thesediffusible pigments.All TPNP isolates were oxidase positive, oxidative, hydrolysed gelatin rapidly and gave apositive egg-yolk reaction but did not hydrolyse starch, utilise L-rhamnose or erythritol, orproduce either arginine dihydrolase or levan; all induced a hypersensitive response in tobaccoplants; in these characters the isolates did not differ from those of P. cepacia or P. alliicola testednor from the descriptions of the isolates from plants of these two species given by Ballard et al.(1970). Three cultures (NCPPB 2445, 2451, 2457) were tested for sensitivity to someantibiotics and one inhibitor: they were sensitive to 50 pg of streptomycin, tetracycline,chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline, slightly sensitive to 50 pg of chloramphenicol andinsensitive to 13 units bacitracin, 190 units penicillin, 2 pg tyrothrycin, 50 pg erythromycin,550 pg berberidine and 200 pg sodium selenite (all per disc) in plate assays.Variable characters and those differentiating the pathogen from P. cepacia Burkholder, 1950and P. alliicola (Burkh.) Starr 8c Burkholder 1942 (i.e. the isolates of P. cepacia Burkh. emend.Ballard et al. and P. marginata (McCulloch) Stapp emend. Ballard et al. that are pathogens ofonion) are given in Table 2. There was delayed utilisation (growth in 8-14 days) of (-)-tartrateby one culture, of laevulinate by seven cultures, of glycollate by nine cultures and of L-threonineby four cultures of TPNP; of the two cultures of P. alliicola tested there was delayed utilisationof laevulinate and Gaminovalerate by NCPPB 2500 and of glutarate by NCPPB 947; there wasdelayed utilisation of (-)-tartrate by both strains of P. cepacia.Pectate liquifaction and rot of onion slices were not reported by Ballard et al. (1970), althoughthey quote unpublished data of Vitanza and Hildebrand showing that some strains of P.multivorans (syn. P. cepacia) and some strains of P. marginata (syn. P. alliicola) rot onionslices. As would be expected, all strains of P. cepacia Burkh. and P. alliicola tested by us rotonion slices and degrade pectate gel (Table 2 and Roberts, 1973). DOI:

The major fatty acids in the type strain are C16?:?0 (14.85?%), C18?:?1 ω7c (31.29?%) and summed feature a (C16?:?1 ω7c and/or C16?:?1 ω6c; 34.79?%); in addition, C12?:?0 (8.08?%), C12?:?0 3-OH (3.69?%), C10?:?0 3-OH (3.11?%), C18?:?0 (1.03?%) and C17?:?1 ω8c (<1?%) are detected. It is noteworthy that strains 1NT and 3N lack an unknown fatty acid (equivalent chain length 11.799) that is present in type strains of all of the most closely related species. The carbon sources utilized are indicated in Table?2T2. The utilization of d-xylose, l-rhamnose, d-fucose and potassium gluconate serve as differential characteristics for this species.The type strain, 1NT (=LMG 24676T=CIP 109853T), was isolated from an evaporative lagoon in Cuatro Cie?negas, Coahuila State, Mexico.  The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S rRNA sequences of strains 1NT and 3N are EU791281 and EU791282, respectively.A figure showing a pulsed-field electrophoresis gel of novel strains described in this work and type and reference strains of known Pseudomonas species is available with the online version of this paper.

Isolated from a drinking (raw) water reservoir. Clinical significance is unknown. The G¬C content of the DNA is 61.0 mol%. The type strain of P. extremorientalis is KMM 3447 (LMG 19695).On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, a novel species belonging to the genus Pseudomonas sensu stricto was identified. The saprophytic, fluorescent bacterium, designated KMM 3447T, was isolated from a drinking water reservoir near Vladivostok City, Russia. The novel organism was a Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that produced a cyclic depsipeptide with surface-active properties. It degraded casein, but did not degrade gelatin, starch, agar or Tween 80. Thebacterium was also Haemolytic. Growth of the novel bacterium occurred between 4 and 35 °C. The predominant cellular fatty acids of the novel pseudomonad were C16:0, C16:1(n-7), C18:1(n-7) and C17:0 cyclo ; branched fatty acids were only found in trace amounts. The GMC content of the novel bacterium was 61<0 mol%. 16S rDNA sequence analysis indicated that the novel bacterium had a clear affiliation with Pseudomonas fluorescens and species closely related to this recognized pseudomonad. DNA–DNA hybridization experimentsshowed that the novel bacterium bound at low levels (27–53%) with the DNA of the type strains of its nearest phylogenetic relatives, namely Pseudomonas tolaasii, Pseudomonas veronii, Pseudomonas orientalis and Pseudomonas rhodesiae, indicating that the novel bacterium represented a novel species within the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas extremorientalis is proposed; the type strain is KMM 3447T (¯LMG 19695T).Strain KMM 3447T, isolated from a drinking water reservoir, had all of the phenotypic characteristics of the fluorescent pseudomonads. The bacterium was Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, oxidaseand catalase-positive, rod-shaped, 0.8–1.0 µm in diameter and 2.0–3.5 µm in length with a single polar flagellum. Colonies were uniformly round, 3–6 mm in diameter, circular, regular, convex, smooth and slightly whitish after incubation of the organism for 48 h on TSA. Cells produced a fluorescent pigment on King’s B medium, but did not produce phenazine pigments on King’s A medium. The bacterium did not accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate as an intracellular reserve product and did not have an arginine dihydrolase system, but it reduced nitrate to nitrite, was positive for arginine dihydrolase and lecithinase activities, was Haemolytic on blood agar and tolerated up to 6% NaCl in the culture medium. The temperature range for growth of KMM 3447T was 4 –35 °C, with an optimum temperature of 25 °C; no growth was detected at 42 °C. The pH range of growth was 6±0–10.0, with optimum growth at pH 7.0. KMM 3447T decomposed casein. Gelatin, Tween 80, starch, agar and chitin were not hydrolysed by the bacterium, and indole and acetoin were not produced by it. Of the 95 carbohydrates tested using the BIOLOG GN test kit, KMM 3447T did not oxidize -glucose, melibiose, lactose, adonitol, -rhamnose, -fucose, myoinositol, α-cyclodextrin, gentiobiose, N-acetyl-- galactosamine, i-erythritol, -raffinose, α-hydroxybutyric acid, p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, hydroxy-- proline, -ornithine, -phenylalanine, phenylethylamine, putrescine nor 2,3-butanediol. The antibacterial susceptibility profile of KMM 3447T was essentially similar to those of Pseudomonas tolaasii, Pseudomonas veronii, P. rhodesiae and Pseudomonas orientalis. KMM 3447T was susceptible to gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin and tetracycline, and was resistant to ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, carbenicillin, lincomycin and polymyxin. Anti-tumour and antimicrobial activities of butanol extracts of KMM 3447T against Staphylococcus aureus CIP 103594T, Escherichia coli ATCC 15034, Proteus vulgaris IFO 3851T, Enterococcus faecium CIP 104105, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051T and Candida albicans KMM 455 were not detected."
DMBP00001642	Pseudomonas ficuserectae sp. nov. Pseudomonas ficuserectae (fi.cus.e.rećtae. Ficus erecta name of host species; L. n. ficuserectae of Ficus erecta) cells are gram-negative, non-encapsulated, nonsporeforming rods with an average size of 2.0 by 0.5 μm and are motile by means of one to five polar flagella (Fig. 1). Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate granules accumulate. Colonies on yeast extract-peptone agar plates at 28°C are white, transparent, circular, convex, and 0.1 to 0.3 mm in diameter after 2 days and 2 to 3 mm in diameter after 6 days. Growth on yeast extract-peptone agar slants becomes very viscid after several days.Pseudomonas ficuserectae was identical to the other four species studied in being positive for the following tests: motility, aerobic growth, catalase reaction, oxidative metabolism of fructose, alkaline reaction of litmus milk, growth in 3% NaCl, utilization of l-galactose, fructose, malate, fumarate, succinate, and citrate, and tobacco hypersensitive reaction. Negative reactions were obtained in the following tests: Gram stain, growth factor requirement, denitrification, utilization of arginine and betaine as carbon sources, arginine dihydrolase, starch hydrolysis, decarboxylase reaction with lysine and ornithine, phenylalanine deaminase, growth in 5% NaCl and 0.0075% KCN, indole production, methyl red test, acetoin production, potato rot, and utilization of d-galactose, maltose, trehalose, erythritol, dulcitol, xylan, inulin, glycogen, starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, salicin, α-methyl-d-glucoside, esculin, oxalate, glycolate, butyrate, sebacate, hippurate, arginine, betaine, valine, and ethylene glycol.Additional characteristics of Pseudomonas ficuserectae that differentiate this species from Pseudomonas amygdali, Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes subsp. citrulli, Pseudomonas andropogonis, and Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola are shown in Table 2. Pseudomonas ficuserectae is clearly distinguished from Pseudomonas andropogonis and Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola by its limited ability to utilize sugars and sugar alcohols and from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes subsp. citrulli in the limited number of organic acids utilized, as well as by its negative reactions in some physiological and biochemical tests. In contrast, Pseudomonas ficuserectae is similar to Pseudomonas, amygdali in phenotypic characteristics (8). The differences between these two species are shown in Table 3. In addition to differences in seven biochemical properties and G+C content, the strains of Pseudomonas amygdali are quite distinctive in that their growth on yeast extract-peptone agar plates is retarded; colonies are only 0.3 to 1.0 mm in diameter after 7 days at 28°C in contrast to P. ficuserectae colonies, which are 3 to 4 mm in diameter. The delayed growth of Pseudomonas amygdali on agar plates is consistent even after repeated subculturing on the same medium.doi:

They are oxidase-positive and can grow aerobically and anaerobically only in the presence of nitrate. Cells are motile and multiple polar flagella were observed under transmission electron microscopy. After 48 h incubation at 25 °C on Lysogeny agar, colonies were tiny (diameter approximately 1 mm), round, convex, beige, bright and with entire margins. Able to grow in LB at 4–30 °C [optimum at 25 °C] and in up to 4 % NaCl (w/v) [optimum at 1 % NaCl (w/v)]. No growth was detected at 37 °C. A set of relevant metabolic and biochemical capacities, assessed by API 20 NE strips, allow their discrimination from the type strains of the phylogenetically closely related species: urease activity is negative and Aesculin/gelatin hydrolysis are positive; indole is not produced; glucose fermentation is negative; assimilation of mannose, N-acetylglucosamine and adipate are positive; and utilization of raffinose, lactose, cellobiose, and sucrose are negative. The negative arginine dihydrolase activity could be a key feature to readily distinguish KG01T because all of the closest relative species are able to metabolize arginine.

DMBP00001647	"flu.o.res'cens. L. n. fluor a flux; M.L. v. fluoresce, M.L. part. adj.fluorescens fluorescing.Characteristics of the species are given in Tables 1, 5, 6.8, and 12. Optimum temperature, 25-30°C. Found in soil and water, from which it can be isolated after enrichment in media containing various carbon sources, incubated aerobically; strains of the denitrifying biovars can be enriched in similar media containing nitrate, incubated under anaerobic conditions. Commonly associated with spoilage of foods (eggs, cured meats, fish, and milk). Often isolated from clinical specimens. Some strains assigned to this species (biovar II) have been isolated from diseased plants (e.g., lettuce), and identified as Pseudomonas marginalis (Brown, 1918) Stevens 1925AL. For more details on this species see the description below. Biovar I (biotype A of Stanier et al., 1966) is considered to by typical of P. fluorescens, and the type strain of the species belongs to this group. Aside from P. marginalis strains, biovar II (previously biotype B) also includes saprophytic organisms. In their studies on the species P. aurantiacaNakhimovskaya 1948, Kiprianova et al. (1985) found that thetype strain was actually P. aureofaciens (now a subspecies of P.chlororaphis), but they propose to retain the name P. aurantiaca for the pigmented strains of biovar II of P. fluorescens.Within biovar III (biotype C of Stanier et al., 1966) at least two subgroups, which differ from each other in their capacity for utilization of dicarboxylic acids, can be defined. Biovar IV (biotype F of Stanier et al., 1966) contains the type strain of""P. lemonnieri"" (Lasseur 1913) Breed 1948, 178. Several strainsare known at present, and these can be grouped into at least two clusters.The group of miscellaneous strains assigned to P. fluorescens biotype G by Stanier et al. (1966) constitutes the last (V) biovar of the species.  The biovar is very heterogeneous in its nutritional properties, and it may consist of strains that have lost one or more of the properties considered to be of diagnostic importance in differentiating among the better characterized biovars.  Among the non-authentic strains assigned to this biovar are strains labeled ""P. schuylkilliensis"" and P. geniculata (Wright 1895) Chester 1901, 313AL.  (see Stanier et al., 1966).  The group of strains isolated from meat that eventually was described as a new species under the name P. lundensis (Molin et al., 1986) corresponded to a cluster identified within biotype G (Barrett et al., 1986) (see below).  Strains of biovar V are common in various materials, and have been isolated from soils (Sands and Rovira, 1971). It is quite possible that isolation of more strains of each of the different biovars may result in the future in the proposal of new species with the general properties of P. fluorer but circumscribed based on genomic differences. The mol% G+ C of the DNA is 59.4-61.3 (Bd). Type strain: ATCC 13525, DSM 50090, NCIB 9046, N10038. GenBank accession number (16S rRNA): Z76662."

DMBP00001702	Pseudomonas linyingensis (lin.ying.en’sis. N. L. fem. adj. linyingensis pertaining to Linying, in Henan province, China, where the type strain was isolated).Cells are Gram-negative, strictly aerobic short-rods, 0.6–0.8 × 0.8–1.3 μm, motile with single flagellum.

DMBP00001703	 Pseudomonas lundensis sp. nov. (lund.en’sis. M.L. adj. lundensis referring to the city of Lund, Sweden). An extensive phenotypic characterization of the species and lists of strains have been published by Molin and Ternstrom (3, 4). A detailed genotypic characterization has been published by Ursing (in press). Two peripheral strains of cluster 2 of Molin and Ternstrom (3), strains 99 and 102, are not considered to belong to P. lundensis. These strains did not cluster with other strains when the Jaccard coefficient and the clustering level definition of Molin and Ternstrom were used (4); they are less vigorous, exhibit several atypical reactions, and, furthermore, were not included in P. lundensis when genetic criteria were used (Ursing, in press). The description below is based on 60 strains.Cells grown in batch cultures are typically 0.7 to 1.0 by 1.5 to 3.0 μm, but cells in their natural habitat on meat and cells grown in continuous cultures are frequently quite small (0.5 to 0.7 by 1.0 to 1.5 μm). The cells are asporogenous, gram negative, rod shaped, and motile at 25°C by means of a polar flagellum. Colonies on nutrient agar (Oxoid Ltd.) are 1 to 5 mm in diameter after 3 days of incubation at 25°C, circular, and smooth. Pigments are usually not formed on nutrient agar, but a greenish tinge due to the formation of fluorescent pigments may be observed. Fluorescent pigments are produced by all strains on King B agar, although detection of pigments may require a fluorimetric assay. Metabolism is respiratory and never fermentative. Oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor; nitrate does not serve as an alternate electron acceptor. The temperature range for growth is usually 0 to 33°C, but 30% of the strains are capable of slow growth at 37°C. The optimal growth temperature is 25°C. There is no growth at pH 4.5. No growth factors are required. No flocks with dendritic outgrowths are formed. The organism is strictly chemoorganotrophic; Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate is not accumulated as a carbon reserve material. Arginine dihydrolase is present. The cells are catalase and cytochrome oxidase positive. All strains except strains 134, 313, 436, and 500 liquefy gelatin. No strain except strain 469 produces lipase against Tween 80. All strains produce acid but no gas from l-arabinose, d-galactose, d-glucose, d-manriose, d-ribose, cellobiose, maltose, melibiose, and d-xylose; the last four sugars do not serve as single-carbon sources in assimilation tests.Production of acid from glycerol and l-rhamnose varies between strains, as does the production of urease and proteolytic attack of egg yolk and casein.The following substances are assimilated by at least 90% of the strains within 7 days of incubation at 25°C (negative strains are indicated in parentheses): acetate, l-α-alanine, P-alanine, 4-aminobutyrate, 2-aminoethandl (strain 178), 5-aminopentanoate, l-arabinose (strain 45), l-arginine, l-asparagine, l-aspartate, betaine (strains 65 and 137), citrate (strain 478), d-fructose, fumarate, d-gluconate (strains 321, 322, 323, and 325), d-glucose, l-glutamate, l-glutamine, glycerate (strain 573T), glycerol (strain 478), heptanoate, l-histidine, meso-inositol (strains 137, 358, 424, 425, 433, and 436), l-lactate (strains 313 and 326), l-leucine (strain 359), l-malate (strains 8 and 178), l-ornithine, 2-oxoglutarate, pelargonate, l-phenylalanine, l-proline, propionate, putrescine, pyruvate, succinate, dl-tyrosine, and dl-valine (strain 359). The assimilation of the following substances is variable (the percentages of positive strains are indicated in parentheses): d-arabinose (77%), benzoate (70%), carnosine (32%), creatine (78%), deoxycholate (85%), d-galactose (13%), dl-hydroxybutyrate (16%), l-isoleucine (89%), d-malate (21%), d-ribose (43%), sarcosine (89%), and taurocholate (88%). Assimilation of butyrate, caproate, l-lysine, d-mannose, and trehalose is slow, and the results depend on the incubation time.The characteristics and substances assimilated by less than 10% of the strains are given below in the type strain description.The mean guanine-plus-cytosine content of the DNAs of 10 strains is 59 mol% (range, 58 to 60 mol%).Strains 338 and 385 of Molin and Temstrom (4) have been deposited in the Czechoslovak Collection of Microorganisms.  Type strain 138 (= 573 = CCM 3503) was isolated from beef. Most of the tests (see below) were performed on three different occasions in two laboratories. Cell characteristics The cells are gram-negative, motile by means of one polarly inserted flagellum (although no statistical evaluation has been performed), 0.7 to 0.8 by 1.5 to 3.0 μm, asporogenous, and rod shaped. Colonial characteristics Colonies on nutrient agar are smooth, circular, and nonpigmented. They are nonhemolytic on ox blood agar and do not glide on cytophaga agar. Biochemical and physiological characteristics Accumulation of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate as intracellular inclusions does not occur. The temperature range for growth is 0 to 33°C, with optimal growth at 25°C. Growth occurs in the absence of NaCl, but at least 6% NaCl is tolerated when cells are grown on plates and approximately 5% NaCl (but not 6% NaCl) is tolerated when cells are grown in broth.Arginine dihydrolase, catalase, and cytochrome c oxidase are produced. A fluorescent pigment (pyoverdine) is produced on King B medium. Phenazine pigments are not produced on King A medium. Growth occurs on Simmons citrate agar, hippurate is hydrolyzed, and tyrosine is decomposed. Gelatin is liquefied, although this capability seems to be unstable after subculturing. Small amounts of proteases against casein are also produced, but the standard method (1) frequently fails to detect them. Action on egg yolk is characterized by a weak egg yolk reaction and a definite clearing zone. There is no action against DNA or ribonucleic acid. No lipases against Tween 20, Tween 40, Tween 60, Tween 80, Tween 85, or tributyrin are produced.There is no growth on alginate and pectate agar; phenylalanine is not deaminated; lysine and ornithine are not decarboxylated; esculin and starch are not hydrolyzed; hydrogen sulfide (triple sugar iron), indole, phosphatase, and urease are not produced; nitrate is not reduced to nitrogen gas; trimethylamineoxide is not reduced; extracellular polysaccharides are not synthesized; and methyl red and Voges-Proskauer reactions are negative.Acid without gas is produced aerobically but never anaerobically from l-arabinose, cellobiose, d-galactose, d-glucose, maltose, d-mannose, melibiose, d-ribose, and d-xylose on modified Hugh-Leifson medium (4). Acid is not produced from amygdalin, dextrin, d-fructose, galactitol, glucitol, glycogen (oyster), meso-inositol, inulin, lactose, d-mannitol, melezitose, raffinose, ribitol, salicin, l-sorbose, starch, sucrose, trehalose, or xylitol. No significant amount of acid (no zone) is produced from glycerol, although the bacterial growth may turn yellow. The data for acid production from l-rhamnose are conflicting.

When grown on agar, the cells are almost coccoid (0.5 x 0.8 μm), but the length increases to about 1.5 um during the exponential phase in broth.  The colonies have a typical fluorescence that is not imparted to the medium.  Nitrate is reduced to nitrite.  Gelatin not liquefied.  Starch is hydrolyzed. Isolated from oil-water emulsions used as lubricants and cooling agents in the cutting and grinding of metals.  Apparently the organism lives on some normal constituent of the cutting compound, probably the naphthenic acids, which act as emulsifying agents.  Consequently, the name oleovorans may not be appropriate.

Other properties of interest are summarized in Tables I and 7. The characteristics that are useful for a separation from P. aeruginosa andP. fluorescensinclude the inability to liquefy gelatin, to produce any phenazine pigments, to denitrify or to give an egg-yolk reaction, and to grow at 41°C. In this constellation of negative properties, the incapacity to hydrolyze gelatin is the one that has classically defined P. putida. Optimum temperature, 25-30°C.Isolated from soil and water after enrichment in mineral media with various carbon sources. The majority of the strains have been assigned to biovar A (biotype A of Stanier et al., 1966), which is considered typical. Biovar B differs from biovar A only in a few phenotypic properties: all known strains of this biovar utilize L-tryptophan, kynurenine, and anthranilate, and most use p-galactose as carbon sources.None of the strains of biovar B uses nicotinate. Recent studies on many strains of this species, combining a numerical analysis of phenotypic data with rRNA gene restriction patterns (ribotyping), have indicated the convenience of a revision of its present internal subdivision into biovars (Elomari et al., 1994), as previously suggested by Barrett et al. (1986) and by Stenstr?m et al. (1990) (see also the sections on taxonomic comments and on ribotyping, in particular the contributionby Brosch et al., 1996).The mol% G+ C of the DNA is: 62.5 (biovar A; thermal denaturation); 60.7 (biovar B).+Type strain: ATCC 12633, DSM 291, NCIB 9494.GenBank accession number (16S TRNA): D37923

Alkalihalobacillus bacillus living in alkaline and salty conditions].Rod-shaped cells exhibiting Gram-positive or Gram-variable staining. Most species are aerobic, but some members are facultatively anaerobic. All studied members, except Alkalihalobacillus okhensis, are reported to form endospores. Isolated from diverse environments including soil, hypersaline lakes and marine coastal regions. Most species exhibit motility generally through peritrichous flagella, but some are reported to be nonmotile. The majority of species from this genus are alkaliphilic and halotolerant or halophilic and they grow in the pH range between 6–11, with optimal growth occurring around pH 9–10 in the presence of 1–5 % NaCl. Some species are obligately alkaliphilic requiring highly alkaline pH for growth. Growth occurs in the range 4–45 °C, with optimum growth temperature in the range 25–37 °C. Several species from this genus are of considerable industrial interest due to their production of enzymes such as cellulases, proteases for inclusion in laundry detergents, xylanases for use in the pulp paper industry and cyclodextrin glucanotransferase for manufacture of cyclodextrin from starch. Include species (Alkalihalobacillus rhizosphaerae), which are diazotrophic and can fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia and other species such as Alkalihalobacillus clausii, which exhibit probiotic activity due to production of antimicrobial compounds. Members of this genus form a monophyletic clade in phylogenetic trees based on concatenated sequences for different large datasets of proteins. Additionally, the members of this genus can be reliably distinguished from all other Bacillaceae species by the 10 CSIs described in Table 5 found in the following proteins, viz. RNase adapter RapZ, flagellar basal body M-ring protein FliF, 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase QueE, peptide chain release factor 3, type I glutamate--ammonia ligase, tRNA threonyl-carbamoyladenosine dehydratase, transcription-repair coupling factor, tRNA uridine-5-carboxymethylaminomethyl (34) synthesis enzyme MnmG, 50S ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase, and homoserine kinase, which in most cases are exclusively shared by either all or most members of this genus.The type species is Alkalihalobacillus alcalophilus.10.1099/ijsem.0.003775

L. masc. adj. fragilis fragile (relating to the brittle colonies that may form under some culture conditions).Characteristics are as described for the genus and as given in Table 2, with the following additional characteristics. Cells occur singly or in pairs and have rounded ends. Vacuoles areoften present, particularly in broth media containing a fermentable carbohydrate. Surface colonies on blood agar are 1–3 mm in diameter, circular, entire, low convex, and translucent to semi-opaque. They often have an internal structure of concentric rings when reviewed by obliquely transmitted light. In general, strains produce no hemolysis on blood agar, although a few strains may be slightly hemolytic, particularly in the area of confluent growth. Growth is often enhanced by 20% bile. Growth may occur at 25 or 45∘C. Most strains grow at pH 8.5, but they grow more slowly and less luxuriantly than at pH 7.0. Cells can survive exposure to air for at least 6–8 h. Hemin is either required for growth or markedly stimulates growth. The major fatty acids are C15:0 anteiso, C15:0 iso, C17:0 iso 3-OH, and C16:0. Strains have been isolated from various types of human clinical specimens or conditions including appendicitis, peritonitis, endocarditis, bacteremia, perirectal abscess, infected pilonidal cyst, postsurgical wound infections, and lesions of the urogenital tract; occasionally isolated from the mouth and vagina. It is the major obligately anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative bacterium isolated fromvarious infections. Although Bacteroides fragilis strains show little phenotypic variability, the species comprises genetically heterogeneous strains (Johnson, 1978). A DNA–DNA hybridization study by Johnson and Ault (1978) led to the distinction of two DNA homology groups, I and II, with about 80% of strains isolated in clinical studies assigned to homology group I. Similarly, two genotypically distinct Bacteroides fragilis groups have been identified on the basis of ribotyping, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, PCR-generated fingerprinting, insertion sequence content, 16S rRNA gene sequence alignments, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, and genetic marker sequence analysis (Gutacker et al., 2000, 2002).One group is characterized by the presence of the cfiA gene (encoding a metallo-β-lactamase of Ambler’s class B) and the absence of the cepA gene (encoding a β-lactamase of Ambler’s class A). The second group is characterized by the absence of the cfiA gene and of the associated insertion sequences, the frequent presence of the cepA gene, and a higher genetic heterogeneity (Podglajen et al., 1995; Ruimy et al., 1996).By including strains obtained from Johnson (1978) in their 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison, Ruimy et al. (1996) showed that the two groups described above could be relatedto DNA homology groups II and I, respectively. However, data obtained so far are still insufficient to clarify definitively whether the two groups may be considered as two distinctgenospecies that have diverged recently, or if they represent two Bacteroides fragilis groups not yet separated at the species level, but evolving in this direction.Putative virulence factors of Bacteroides fragilis include attachment mechanisms, relative aerotolerance, extracellular enzyme production, and resistance to complementmediated killing and phagocytosis. A polysaccharide capsule contributes to this resistance and resistance to T-cell activity (Patrick, 2002). An enterotoxin termed Bacteroides fragilis toxin, or BFT, is a recognized virulence factor. BFT has been characterized as a 20-kDa zinc-dependent metalloprotease (Moncrief et al., 1995) that mediates the cleavage of E-cadherin, resulting in an altered morphology of certain human intestinal carcinoma cell lines (particularly HT29/C1cells), fluid accumulation in ligated lamb ileal loops, and intestinal epithelial cell proliferation. It has been reported that the bft gene is contained in a 6-kb pathogenicity island termed the Bacteroides fragilis pathogenicity island or BfPAI (Franco et al., 1999).The genomes of the Bacteroides fragilis type strain, NCTC 9343T, and a clinical strain, YCH46, have been sequenced. The genome of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343T, contains a single circular chromosome of 5,205,140 bp that is predicted to encode 4274 genes and a plasmid, pBF9343. It shows considerable variation, even within the same strain, and “invertable promoters” appear to regulate much of this variance in many surface-exposed and secreted proteins (Cerdeno-Tarraga et al., 2005). The complete genome sequence has revealed an unusual breadth (in number and in effect) of DNA inversion events that potentially control expression of many different components, including surface and secreted components, regulatory molecules, and restriction-modification proteins. This may be related to its niche as a commensal and opportunistic pathogen, because the resulting diversity in surface structures could increase both immune evasion and the ability to colonize novel sites.Source: human clinical specimens.

Oxidase-positive or-negative. Chemo-organotrophic; two species are facultativechemolithotrophs: prototrophs to auxotrophs requiringseveral growth factors. Mostly isolated from soil, or fromenvironments that may have been contaminated directly orindirectly by soil, but also found in water, food and clinicalspecimens. The resistance of the spores to heat, radiation,disinfectants, and desiccation results in species being troublesome contaminants in operating rooms, on surgical dressings,in pharmaceutical products and in foods. Most species havelittle or no pathogenic potential and are rarely associatedwith disease in humans or other animals; an exception isBacillus anthracis, the agent of anthrax; several other speciesmay cause food poisoning and opportunistic infections, andstrains of Bacillus thuringiensis are pathogenic to invertebrates.DNA G + C content (mol%): 32–66 (Tm).Type species: Bacillus subtilis Cohn 1872, 174AL.Number of validated species: 9510.1099/ijs.0.64213-0

Generation time of the proposed B. ivorense sp. nov. CI-1BT strain was estimated at 14 h (±3 h) when cells were grown in RMS liquid cultures and at 27 °C. On RMS agar, colonies are whitish, convex, circular, with 2 to 3 mm diameter after 10 days incubation at 27 °C. Optimal growth was observed at neutral pH, at temperatures comprised between 25 to 30 °C, and at NaCl concentrations<0.5 %. Although some growth still occurred at 20 and 35 °C, plates incubated at 40 °C exhibited no growth. Strains CI-1BT, CI-14A and CI-19D did not show significant inhibition zones when in presence of all antibiotics tested, at least when challenged with discs containing the following amounts: ampicillin 100 µg, chloramphenicol 500 µg, erythromycin 50 µg, gentamycin 50 µg, kanamycin 100 µg, penicillin 10 µg, streptomycin 250 µg or tetracycline 50 µg. Strain CI-41S was found to be sensitive to ampicillin 100 µg but grew in presence of other antibiotic discs. Strains CI-1BT, CI-14A and CI-19D were all positive for oxidase, arginine dihydrolase and urease reactions, while only CI-1BT responded weakly to aesculin hydrolysis. These same three strains were all negative for catalase, d-glucose fermentation, gelatin hydrolysis, indole production, nitrate reduction and para-nitrophenyl-βd-galactopyranosidase reactions. Assimilation tests were positive for adipic acid, d-glucose, maltose, d-mannitol, d-mannose, l-arabinose, N-acetyl-glucosamine and potassium gluconate; weak for malic acid, trisodium citrate, phenylacetic acid; and negative for capric acid. In addition, CI-1BT and CI-41S were found to assimilate fructose, galactose, malate and pyruvic acid; but apparently could not use sucrose as sole carbon source. Effective nodules were formed on C. cajan, M. atropurpureum, V. radiata, V. unguiculata and T. vogelii but not on G. max and L. leucocephala.The type strain, CI-1BT (=CCOS 1862T=CCMM B1296T) was isolated from a root nodule of a C. cajan plant growing in Kossou-Bouafla, Côte d’Ivoire.

Most species are aerobic, but some members are facultatively anaerobic. All studied members, except Alkalihalobacillus okhensis, are reported to form endospores. Isolated from diverse environments including soil, hypersaline lakes and marine coastal regions. Most species exhibit motility generally through peritrichous flagella, but some are reported to be nonmotile. The majority of species from this genus are alkaliphilic and halotolerant or halophilic and they grow in the pH range between 6–11, with optimal growth occurring around pH 9–10 in the presence of 1–5 % NaCl. Some species are obligately alkaliphilic requiring highly alkaline pH for growth. Growth occurs in the range 4–45 °C, with optimum growth temperature in the range 25–37 °C. Several species from this genus are of considerable industrial interest due to their production of enzymes such as cellulases, proteases for inclusion in laundry detergents, xylanases for use in the pulp paper industry and cyclodextrin glucanotransferase for manufacture of cyclodextrin from starch. Include species (Alkalihalobacillus rhizosphaerae), which are diazotrophic and can fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia and other species such as Alkalihalobacillus clausii, which exhibit probiotic activity due to production of antimicrobial compounds. Members of this genus form a monophyletic clade in phylogenetic trees based on concatenated sequences for different large datasets of proteins. Additionally, the members of this genus can be reliably distinguished from all other Bacillaceae species by the 10 CSIs described in Table 5 found in the following proteins, viz. RNase adapter RapZ, flagellar basal body M-ring protein FliF, 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase QueE, peptide chain release factor 3, type I glutamate--ammonia ligase, tRNA threonyl-carbamoyladenosine dehydratase, transcription-repair coupling factor, tRNA uridine-5-carboxymethylaminomethyl (34) synthesis enzyme MnmG, 50S ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase, and homoserine kinase, which in most cases are exclusively shared by either all or most members of this genus.The type species is Alkalihalobacillus alcalophilus.10.1099/ijsem.0.003775
DMBP00001825	Although Dunlap et al. [1] R1indicated that Brevibacterium halotolerans Delaporte and Sasson 1967 (Approved Lists 1980) is known not to be a member of the genus Brevibacterium it is important to confirm whether assignment to the genus Bacillus is not based on the properties of a single deposit in one culture collection. A search of the information available on the internet indicates that Brevibacterium halotolerans Delaporte and Sasson 1967 (Approved Lists 1980) was initially deposited in the collection in Paris (CIP) as CIP 67.21, for which a 16S rRNA gene sequence has been determined and it is available via the online catalogue. ATCC 25096, a strain that was accessed directly from the Institute Pasteur has had its genome sequence determined, as reported by Dunlap et al. [1] and it is deposited in GenBank under the access number LPVF01000000. The DSMZ catalogue entry for DSM 8802, a strain obtained via H. Seiler in Weihenstephan, who in turn had obtained the strain from the ATCC (i.e. ATCC 25096) indicated that the 16S rRNA gene sequence had also been determined and deposited under the accession number AM747812. Alignment of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain CIP 67.21 (1419 bases) against that of DSM 8802 (AM747812, 1545 bases) showed no differences over the 1419 bases that are common to both. Similarly, the alignment of the 16S rRNA gene sequence from DSM 8802 (AM747812, 1545 bases) against the 16S rRNA gene annotated in the genome of ATCC 25096 in contig LPVF01000003 as [region complement (3036…>4590), /locus_tag=‘AU387_20080’ /product=‘16S ribosomal RNA’] showed an alignment over 1540 bases with no differences observed. Consequently, within the limitations of the resolution of 16S rRNA gene sequences, taken together with strain histories it can be concluded that CIP 67.21, ATCC 25096 and DSM 8802 are members of the same taxon and may represent deposits of the type strain in three different collections in three different countries.Based on the evidence presented by Dunlap et al. [1] indicating that Bacillus axarquiensis Ruiz-García et al. 2005, Bacillus malacitensis Ruiz-García et al. 2005 and Brevibacterium halotolerans Delaporte and Sasson 1967 (Approved Lists 1980) should be treated as heterotypic synonyms and that the epithet halotolerans Delaporte and Sasson 1967 (Approved Lists 1980) has priority, it is necessary to create the combination Bacillus halotolerans (Delaporte and Sasson 1967).Bacillus halotolerans (Delaporte and Sasson 1967) comb. nov.10.1099/ijsem.0.001589

DMBP00001830	 Bacillus cereus. Bacillus cereus is next in importance to Bacillus anthracis as a pathogen of humans (and other animals), causing food-borne illness and opportunistic infections, and its ubiquity ensures that cases are not uncommon.In relation to food-borne illness, Bacillus cereus is the etiological agent of two distinct food poisoning syndromes (Kramer and Gilbert, 1992): (i) the diarrheal-type, characterized byabdominal pain with diarrhea 8–16 h after ingestion of the contaminated food and associated with a diversity of foods from meats and vegetable dishes to pastas, desserts, cakes, sauces, and milk, and (ii) the emetic-type characterized by nausea and vomiting 1–5 h after eating the offending food, predominantly oriental rice dishes, although occasionally other foods such as pasteurized cream, milk pudding, pastas, and reconstituted formulas have been implicated.One outbreak followed the mere handling of contaminated rice in a children’s craft activity (Briley et al., 2001), and fulminant liver failure associated with the emetic toxin has been reported (Mahler et al., 1997). Both syndromes arise as a direct result of the fact that Bacillus cereus spores can survive normal cooking procedures. Under improper storage conditions after cooking, the spores germinate and the vegetative cells multiply. In diarrheal illness, the toxin(s) responsible are produced by organisms in the small intestine (infective doses 104 –109 cells per gram of food), while the emetic toxin is preformed and ingested in food (about105 –108 cells per gram in order to produce sufficient toxin).Variations in infective dose of the diarrheal illness will reflect the proportion of ingested cells that are sporulated, and so can survive the acid barrier of the stomach. The capacity of the strain concerned to produce toxin(s) will, of course, influence the infective or intoxicating dose in both types of illness. It is likely that cases showing both diarrheal and emetic symptoms are caused by organisms producing both diarrheal and emetic toxins. Strains of Bacillus thuringiensis, which are close relatives of Bacillus cereus, may also produce the diarrheal toxin, and Bacillus thuringiensis has indeed been implicated in cases of gastroenteritis (Damgaard et al., 1997); strains of this species commonly carry genes for Bacillus cereus enterotoxins (Rivera et al., 2000) and Fletcher and Logan (1999) found that strains of both Bacillus mycoidesand Bacillus thuringiensis were positive in commercial tests for enterotoxin and in a cytotoxicity assay. Cases of illness caused by Bacillus thuringiensis may have been diagnosed as caused by Bacillus cereus, as the former may not produce its characteristic insecticidal toxin crystals when incubated at 37∘C, owing to the loss of the plasmids carrying the toxin genes (Granum, 2002). The safety of using Bacillus thuringiensis as a biopesticide on crop plants has been reviewed by Bishop (2002); Bishop et al. (1999) found that the main pesticide strains that they assayed produced low titers of enterotoxin.

DMBP00001840	Aeromonas veroniiHickman-Brenner, MacDonald, Steigerwalt, Fanning, Brenner and Farmer 1988b, 220VP (Effective publication: Hickman-Brenner, MacDonald, Steigerwalt, Fanning, Brenner and Farmer 1987, 901.)...................................................................................ve.ro’ ni.i. M.L. gen. n. veronii of Véron, named after M.M. Véron.Hybridization Groups 8/10 of 17 (Popoff et al., 1981; Farmer et al., 1986).Subsequent to the proposal for this species (formerly termed Enteric Group 77 and HG 10), it was learned that although they had different biochemical reactions, HG 8 was genetically identical to HG 10. Thus, A. veronii contained two biogroups (Kuijper et al., 1989a; Altwegg et al., 1990). The first was the originally proposed ornithine decarboxylase positive species, A. veronii (HG 10) (Hickman-Brenner et al., 1987). The second group was lysine decarboxylase positive, arginine dihydrolase positive, and ornithine decarboxylase negative, and contained the so-called “clinical” A. sobria (HG 8). While the HG 7 environmental strains of A. sobria and the former HG 8 A. sobria are phenotypically very similar, they are genetically and clinically quite different. For this reason, it was decided to place the two biogroups of A. veronii into two separate biovars, namely biovar veronii and biovar sobria (Joseph et al., 1991).The mol% G+C of the DNA is: undetermined.Type strain: ATCC 35624, DSM 7386.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA): X74684.Note that the species name Aeromonas ichthiosmia (Schubert et al., 1990b) has been validly published, but has beenunarguably shown to be identical to A. veronii (Carnahan,1992; Collins et al., 1993, Huys et al., 2001) (see Taxonomic Comments).Aeromonas veroniibiovar veronii...................................................................................String test negative, produces gas from D-glucose, is resistant to O/129, and grows in the absence of added NaCl.

DMBP00001857	AbstractSix bacterial strains isolated from root nodules of soybean plants that had been inoculated with root-zone soil of legumes native to Canada were previously characterized and 1) placed in two novel lineages within the genus Bradyrhizobium and 2) assigned to symbiovar septentrionale. Here we verified the taxonomic status of these strains using genomic and phenotypic analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of five protein encoding partial gene sequences as well as 52 full length ribosome protein subunit gene sequences confirmed placement of the novel strains in two highly supported lineages distinct from named Bradyrhizobium species. The highest average nucleotide identity values of strains representing these two lineages relative to type strains of closest relatives were 90.7 and 92.3% which is well below the threshold value for bacterial species circumscription. The genomes of representative strains 1S1T, 162S2 and 66S1MBT have sizes of 10598256, 10733150 and 9032145 bp with DNA G+C contents of 63.5, 63.4 and 63.8 mol%, respectively. These strains possess between one and three plasmids based on copy number of plasmid replication and segregation (repABC) genes. Novel strains also possess numerous insertion sequences, and, relative to reference strain Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA110T, exhibit inversion and fragmentation of nodulation (nod) and nitrogen-fixation (nif) gene clusters. Phylogenetic analyses of nodC and nifH gene sequences confirmed placement of novel strains in a distinct lineage corresponding to symbiovar septentrionale. Data for morphological, physiological and symbiotic characteristics complement the sequence-based results. The data presented here support the description of two new species for which the names Bradyrhizobium septentrionale sp. nov. (sv. septentrionale) and Bradyrhizobium quebecense sp. nov. (sv. septentrionale) are proposed, with 1S1T (=LMG 29930T=HAMBI 3676T) and 66S1MBT (=LMG 31547T=HAMBI 3720T) as type strains, respectively.10.1099/ijsem.0.004831

DMBP00001862	CharacterizationIsolated Acidovorax strains grew well on common, complexgrowth media including NA and R2A with colonies generallyappearing within 24–48 h. Colonies on NA plates grown for 48 hfor each of the strains were pale yellow to yellow in color (creamto pale yellow on R2A plates), circular and convex with entire margins, and up to 1.0–1.5 mm in diameter. Addition of indole to platesresulted in purple colonies for each strain, indicating the probableproduction of indigo from an active aromatic ring-hydroxylatingdioxygenase that catalyzes the initial step of aerobic bacterial polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation [17].Growth was observed for all four stains at temperatures testedbetween 15 ◦C and 35 ◦C, with optimal growth at 30–32.5 ◦C for allstrains. Weak growth was observed after two weeks of incubationat 4 ◦C, 37 ◦C, and 40 ◦C in regions of the plates with the densestinoculum for all strains but P4, which did not grow at 40 ◦C. Allstrains grew at pH 6.0–8.0, with optimal growth at either 7.0 or 7.5.In addition, strain NA3T grew weakly at pH 5.5 and strains P3 andP4 at pH 8.5. All strains grew optimally without amended salt butcould tolerate 1% NaCl; no growth was observed after 24 h in mediasupplemented with 2–5% NaCl. No growth was observed underanaerobic conditions onthemedia tested.All subsequenttests weregenerally conducted in media at a pH of 7.5, a temperature of 30 or32.5 ◦C, and with no amended salt.Under scanning electron microscopy, all four strains wereobserved to be slightly-curved or straight rods without distinguishing external features (Fig. 2). The cell sizes rangedfrom 0.9–2.1 × 0.4–0.5 _x0004_m (P3), 0.8–1.6 × 0.4–0.6 _x0004_m (P4),0.8–1.5 × 0.3–0.5 _x0004_m (NA2), and 0.9–1.9 × 0.4–0.5 _x0004_m (NA3T),with average cell sizes (n = 100) of 1.4 × 0.5 _x0004_m (P3), 1.1 × 0.4 _x0004_m(P4), 1.1 × 0.4 _x0004_m (NA2), and 1.2 × 0.4 _x0004_m (NA3T). No flagella wereevident in scanning electron micrographs despite the fact thatAcidovorax isolates typically exhibit one to three polar flagella [62]and the genomic sequences of these four strains indicated thepresence of genes for flagellar synthesis. To examine this apparentdiscrepancy, each strain was inoculated into motility agar stabsand examined after several days of growth. A feathering of growthradiating from each stab indicated motility for all strains. Single,polar flagella were subsequently detected on cells extracted fromthose stabs (Appendix Fig. A.2). The lack of flagella in electronmicrographs was attributed to physical shearing during samplepreparation and/or growth conditions within the preparativemedia.10.1016/j.syapm.2018.06.001

DMBP00001876	AbstractAn isolate of a Gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic, motile, rod-shaped, endospore-forming bacterium was recovered from soybean-based fermented paste. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that the strain was most closely related to Bacillus sonorensis KCTC-13918T (99.5 % similarity) and Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13T (99.4 %). In phenotypic characterization, the novel strain was found to grow at 15–60 °C and to tolerate up to 10 % (w/v) NaCl. Furthermore, the strain grew in media with pH 6–11 (optimal growth at pH 7.0–8.0). The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0 (37.7 %) and iso-C15 : 0 (31.5 %). The predominant isoprenoid quinone was menaquinone 7 (MK-7). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. A draft genome sequence of the strain was completed and used for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenomic analysis of all published genomes of species in the B. licheniformis group revealed that strains belonging to B. licheniformis clustered into two distinct groups, with group 1 consisting of B. licheniformis DSM 13T and 11 other strains and group 2 consisting of KJ-16T and four other strains. The DNA G+C content of strain KJ-16T was 45.9 % (determined from the genome sequence). Strain KJ-16T and another strain from group 2 were subsequently characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach and compared with strains from group 1 and another closely related species of the genus Bacillus. Based upon the consensus of phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses, we conclude that this strain represents a novel species within the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus paralicheniformis sp. nov. is proposed, with type strain KJ-16T ( = KACC 18426T = NRRL B-65293T)10.1099/ijsem.0.000441

DMBP00001879	The B. thaonhiensis (th-ao-nhi-en’-sis, N.L. fem. adj. thaonhiensis, named after Thao-nhi, the daughter of this paper’s author) strain NHI-38T isolated from forest soil is Grampositive, rod-shaped, and motile. After 1 day of growth on R2A, the colonies are 1–3 mm in diameter, cream-colored, circular, viscous, flat, and entire. Endospores are ellipsoidal and lay centrally. The strain grows under aerobic conditions with the following optimal conditions: temperature 35–45 oC; pH 7.0–9.0; and NaCl 0.5 %–1.5 %. When enzyme activities were assessed using the API ZYM Kit, the bacterium was positive for esterase (C4); weak for alkaline phosphatase, esterase lipase (C8), valine arylamidase, naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase, and β-glucosidase; and negative for lipase (C14), leucine arylamidase, cystine arylamidase, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, acid phosphatase, α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase, α-mannosidase, and α-fucosidase.

The type strain, NHI-38T (=KACC 17216T = KEMB 9005-019T = JCM 18863T ), was isolated from forest soil of the Kyonggi University campus in Suwon, South Korea (accession number: JQ796719).
DMBP00001880	AbstractTwo strains, designated DW5-4T and NH7I_1T, were isolated from aquaculture water of a shrimp farm of Zhangzhou city in China and from surface sediment of the South China Sea, respectively. Cells of the strains were Gram-stain-positive, oxidase- and catalase-positive, rod-shaped and motile. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains belonged to the Bacillus pumilus clade. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between strains DW5-4T and NH7I_1T was 99.8 %, and between each of the two strains and four type strains, B. pumilus ATCC 7061T, Bacillus safensis FO-36bT, Bacillus altitudinis 41KF2bT and Bacillus xiamenensis HYC-10T, were above 99.4 %. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization value between the two novel strains was 41.6 %, and between each of the two strains and the four above-mentioned type strains were below 53.0 %. In both strains, the principal fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0, and the isoprenoid quinone was identified as MK-7 (100 %). The DNA G+C contents of strains DW5-4T and NH7I_1T were 41.4 and 41.3 mol%, respectively. Based on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, two novel species of the genus Bacillus are proposed: Bacillus zhangzhouensis sp. nov., with DW5-4T ( = MCCC 1A08372T = LMG 27144T = KCTC 33531T) as the type strain, and Bacillus australimaris sp. nov., with NH7I_1T ( = MCCC 1A05787T = LMG 27697T = KCTC 33532T) as the type strain.10.1099/ijsem.0.000856

DMBP00001882	Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum (long′um. L. neut. adj. longum long) (Reuter 1963).On TPY agar, strains of this species show mostly very elongated and relatively thin cellular elements with slightly irregular contours and rare branchings. In TPY broth, most strains develop with uniform turbidity, clearing is slow and the sediment is viscous. B. longum is apparently the only species among those usually found in human faeces which possesses a large variety of plasmids (Sgorbati et al., 1982). Concerning DNA–DNA relatedness (63–81 %), this subspecies is most closely related to B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. suis (Scardovi et al. 1979; Lauer & Kandler, 1983; Bahaka et al., 1993; Sakata et al., 2002). The genome of B. longum NCC 2705 (GenBank accession no. AE014295) was the first to be completely sequenced among the genus Bifidobacterium. Sequencing the DNA of this strain has revealed much about its metabolic diversity and generated insights into other members of the genus (Schell et al., 2002). Bioinformatic analysis revealed several physiological traits that could partially explain the successful adaptation of this bacterium to the colon. An unexpectedly large number of the predicted proteins appeared to be specialized for catabolism of a variety of oligosaccharides, some possibly released by rare or novel glycosyl hydrolases acting on ‘non-digestible’ plant polymers or host-derived glycoproteins and glycoconjugates. B. longum DJ010A is presently available as a partly assembled genome (GenBank accession no. AABM00000000) (Leahy et al., 2005). Strains have been isolated from infant and adult human faeces, from faeces of suckling calf, from human vagina and from sewage. For the original description, see Reuter (1963). The genomic G+C content is 61 mol% (T m).Type strain: E194b (variant a)T (=ATCC 15707T=DSM 20219T), from faeces of human adult (Reuter, 1963).Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis (in.fan′tis. L. gen. n. infantis of an infant).Cellular morphology does not present specific traits, so that it is similar to that of many other species of the genus. These bifidobacteria do not ferment pentoses. They are found as predominant forms in breast-fed infant faeces.Strains have been isolated from infant faeces, from faeces of suckling calf and from human vagina. Regarding DNA–DNA relatedness (63–81 %), this subspecies is most closely related to B. longum subsp. longum and to B. longum subsp. suis (Scardovi et al. 1979; Lauer & Kandler, 1983; Bahaka et al., 1993; Sakata et al., 2002). For the original description see Reuter (1963). The genomic G+C content is 60.5 mol% (T m).Type strain: S12T (=ATCC 15697T=DSM 20088T), from faeces of human infant (Reuter, 1963).Bifidobacterium longum subsp. suis (su′is. L. n. sus pig; L. sing. gen. n. suis of a pig).Slender cells, elongated (2–6 μm long), with rare terminal bifurcations in the shape of clubs. Non-motile. Gram-positive. Colonies are circular, soft, smooth, white with entire margins. Liquid cultures are at first turbid, after 24–36 h become clear with sediment dispersible by agitation. Anaerobic. CO2 without effect on O2 sensitivity or anaerobic growth. Catalase-negative. Optimum growth at 38–39 °C, minimum 19–20 °C, maximum 44.5–45 °C. Optimum growth at pH 7–8; no growth at pH 5.0 or 9.5. Sugars fermented: arabinose, xylose, glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, maltose, sucrose, lactose, melibiose, raffinose. Rhamnose, melezitose, cellobiose, trehalose, dextrin, starch, inulin, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, salicin, gluconate and lactate are never fermented. No growth in carbohydrate-free media. The end products of glucose fermentation are lactic (LA) and acetic acids (AA), in the ratio 1.0(LA) :  1.7(AA) to 1.0(LA)  : 2.0(AA). Glucose is fermented by fructose-6-phosphate shunt. Cell-free extracts contain fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase, aldolase and HMP dehydrogenase. Nitrites not produced from nitrates. Indole and acetyl-methyl-carbinol not produced. Most strains possess a constitutive urease activity, which is not influenced by urea or organic nitrogen sources. Skimmed milk: acidification followed by coagulation in 1–2 days. Riboflavin is the only growth factor required for growth. The above description is based on data obtained from Matteuzzi et al. (1971).Based on DNA relatedness (66–81 %), this subspecies is most closely related to B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. longum (Lauer & Kandler, 1983; Bahaka et al., 1993; Sakata et al., 2002). So far, found only in the faeces of piglets. The genomic G+C content is 62 mol% (T m).Type strain: Su859T (ATCC 27533T=DSM 20211T), from faeces of piglet (Matteuzzi et al., 1971).

DMBP00001923	Acinetobacter variabilis (va.ri.a′bi.lis. L. masc. adj. variabilis variable, referring to the heterogeneous, strain-dependent phenotypic properties of the species).The phenotypic characteristics correspond to those of the genus (Baumann et al., 1968), i.e. Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, oxidase-negative and catalase-positive coccobacilli typically occurring in pairs, incapable of swimming motility, capable of growing in mineral media with acetate as the sole carbon source and ammonia as the sole source of nitrogen, and incapable of dissimilative denitrification. Positive in the transformation assay (Juni, 1972).Colonies on tryptic soy agar (Oxoid) after 24 h incubation at 30 °C are 1.0–2.5 mm in diameter, grey–white, slightly opaque, circular, convex and smooth, with entire margins. Growth occurs in brain heart infusion (Oxoid) at temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 41 °C and to a certain extent at 44 °C (about one-third of strains weakly positive). Acid is produced from d-glucose by the minority of strains. Gelatin is not hydrolysed. Haemolysis is not observed on agar media supplemented with sheep erythrocytes, although some strains display a greenish discoloration of the agar. Acetate and ethanol are utilized as sole sources of carbon with growth visible in six (mostly two) days of incubation. No growth occurs on β-alanine, l-aspartate, citraconate, gentisate, d-gluconate, d-glucose, histamine, l-histidine, 4-hydroxybenzoate, l-leucine, levulinate, malonate, l-ornithine, putrescine, l-tartrate, tricarballylate, trigonelline, or tryptamine in 10 days. Various numbers of strains utilize trans-aconitate, adipate, 4-aminobutyrate, l-arabinose, l-arginine, azelate, benzoate, 2,3-butanediol, citrate (Simmons), l-glutamate, glutarate, dl-lactate, d-malate, phenylacetate, l-phenylalanine or d-ribose within 6 days (Table 2).The type strain is NIPH 2171T ( = CIP 110486T = CCUG 26390T = NIPH 546T = CCM 8555T = Tjernberg & Ursing 151aT), isolated from urine of a human patient in Malmö , Sweden in the 1980s. It was used as the reference strain of DNA group 15 by Tjernberg & Ursing (1989). The type strain (NIPH 2171T) grows weakly at 44 °C and assimilates azelate, benzoate, 2,3-butanediol, d-malate and phenylacetate. It produces whitish colonies 2.0 mm in diameter on tryptic soy agar after 24 h at 30 °C. Strain NIPH 2171T neither produces acid from d-glucose nor utilizes trans-aconitate, 4-aminobutyrate, l-arabinose, l-arginine, citrate (Simmons), l-glutamate, glutarate, dl-lactate, l-phenylalanine or d-ribose. Growth on adipate is visible between the sixth and tenth day of incubation. The fatty acid pattern of this strain was published by Kämpfer (1993).

L. masc. and fem. n. bos ox, cow; L. gen. n. bovis of the ox/cow.Cells of Actinomyces bovis are usually short and diphtheroidal (Figure 6), but short branching rods (Figure 3) may occur while long multibranched filaments are rarely seen. The two serovars recognized within the species are most easily and reliably identified by direct or indirect fluorescent antibody techniques. In addition, the microcolonies of serovar I strains are usually smooth with an entire to irregular edge, slightly raised to convex, white to colorlessand soft and show only occasionally short radiating filamentsat the edge (Figure 17), while serovar II microcolonies tend to be filamentous (Figure 21) and may even resemble Actinomyces israelii microcolonies (Figure 12). Mature Actinomyces bovis colonies are 0.5–1.0 mm in diameter, circular, with a smooth or finely granular surface, convex, entire-edged,and usually soft (Figure 31). Strains producing filamentous microcolonies also form rough macrocolonies resembling the molar-tooth or bread-crumb colony type of Actinomyces israelii (Figure 33). Catalase-negative. Further morphological details, ultrastructure, cell-wall composition, nutrition and growth conditions, metabolism, and metabolic pathways aswell as drug susceptibility are as given for the genus and as summarized in Table 8. Physiological and other descriptive and differential characteristics are listed in Table 2 and Table 4. The natural habitat is not definitely known especially because in studies on the plaque flora of dairy cattle, Actinomyces bovis could not be identified (Dent and Williams, 1984b,1984c, 1986). However, given the apparently endogenousorigin of bovine infections, the natural habitat is assumed to be the oral cavity and/or the intestinal tract of cattle and possibly other animals. Actinomyces bovis is the causative agent of actinomycosis in cattle (bovine actinomycosis, lumpy jaw). The etiology of similar infections in other animals, including a llama, has not been clarified with certainty although it has been claimed that at least some of these diseases might also be due to Actinomyces bovis. In contrast, this species has never been proved to cause actinomycosis in man, nor has it been isolated from human mucosal surfaces or other human sources. Experimental infections have been produced in hamsters, mice and a few other animal species after intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injections of viable cell suspensions.Source: a typical case of lumpy jaw in a cow.DNA G+C content (mol%): 57–63 (Tm).Type strain: ATCC 13683, CIP 103258, NCTC 11535, CCUG31996, DSM 43014 (serovar I).Reference strain for serovar II: WVU 292.Sequence accession no.

Mature colonies may be highlyfilamentous even showing short aerial hyphae (Figure 25),but smooth and soft colonies are quite common (Figure 26).Catalase-negative. Additional morphological details, cell-wallcomposition, nutrition and growth conditions, metabolismand metabolic pathways as well as drug susceptibility are asgiven for the genus and as summarized in Table 7. Physiological and other descriptive and differential characteristics arelisted in Table 1 and Table 3. The type strain and 12% of theother isolates tested were obligately anaerobic. The pH inpeptone-yeast extract-glucose-Tween 80 medium incubated3–5 d is 4.3–5.3. Addition of Tween 80 to broth mediumincreases the growth of 25% of the cultures and does notaffect the growth of 75%. The species is distinct from Actinomyces israelii sensu stricto as determined by polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis banding patterns, serological reactions, andthe inability to ferment L-arabinose.The normal habitat of Actinomyces gerencseriae is the oralcavity of man including tonsillar crypts and dental plaque.The species was found to account for 1.2% of the humanhealthy periodontal flora and occurred in 14% of the samplesexamined. The respective figures in patients with gingivitis and periodontitis were 1.5% and 17%. It apparentlyalso occurs in lower numbers in the human intestinal andfemale genital tracts. Actinomyces gerencseriae is one of thetypical causative agents of human cervicofacial and otheractinomycoses.

Microcolonies arefilamentous, and the most common and characteristic formis the “spider colony” (Figure 12). Mature colonies measure0.5–2.0 mm in diameter and are predominantly rough withor without central depression. They have been described asmolar-tooth-, bread-crumb-, and raspberry-like (Figure 23and Figure 24), are white to grayish to creamy in color andusually hard and adhering to the medium. In liquid media,they may present as snow ball- or cotton pad-like structures(Figure 38). Catalase-negative. Additional morphologicaldetails, ultrastructure, cell-wall composition, nutrition andgrowth conditions, metabolism, metabolic pathways, anddrug sensitivity are as given for the genus and as summarizedin Table 7. Physiological and other descriptive and differential characteristics are listed in Table 1 and Table 3. Althoughthe species Actinomyces israelii as currently defined wasrestricted to the former Actinomyces israelii serovar I strains, itappears to be still antigenically heterogeneous (Schaal andGatzer, 1985). Furthermore, two additional serological typeswere found among strains fitting the general descriptionof Actinomyces israelii sensu lato. As these serological variantsdiffered from typical members of the taxon in a number ofphysiological characteristics, it remains to be seen whetherthey constitute new serovars of Actinomyces israelii sensu strictoor Actinomyces gerencseriae or deserve species rank.The normal habitat of Actinomyces israelii is the oral cavityof man including tonsillar crypts and dental plaque. Inhumans with healthy gingivae, it could be identified in 6.5%of the samples examined and accounted for 0.4% of the totalflora analyzed. In patients with gingivitis and periodontitis,the respective figures were 9.4% and 0.7%. Furthermore, Actinomyces israelii may be recovered from the mucosal surfacesof the human intestinal and female genital tracts. Actinomycesisraelii is one of the principal causative agents of humancervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic actinomycoses.In addition, it may cause eye infections such as lacrimalcanaliculitis, conjunctivitis or dacryocystitis and is apparentlyalso etiologically involved in the development of cervicitisand endometritis in women using intrauterine contraceptivedevices or vaginal pessaries. Occasionally, Actinomyces israelii(or Actinomyces gerencseriae) has been reported from animalinfections such as actinomycoses in cattle or swine andpyogenic granulomas in a mandrill. However, it is not definite whether these isolates were correctly identified. Sulfurgranules are characteristically, but not obligatorily producedin human infections. After intraperitoneal, intravenous, orsubcutaneous injection, Actinomyces israelii produces abscessformation in a variety of experimental animals includinghamsters, mice, and rabbits. The pathological lesions thusinduced resemble naturally occurring actinomycoses to acertain extent, but are usually self-limited and not progressiveunless at least one typical concomitant organism is added tothe challenge injection.Source (type strain): a human brain abscess.DNA G+C content (mol%): 63–70 (Tm).Type strain: ATCC 12102, CCUG 18307, CIP 103259, DSM43320, JCM 12964, NCTC 12972.Additional reference strain: ATCC 10048, which differs serologically from the type strain.Sequence accession no.

N.L. gen. masc. n. naeslundii of Naeslund, tohonor Carl Naeslund from Sweden, who first described thisorganism in some detail, but did not give it a species epithet.The species contains strains previously identified as Actinomyces naeslundii serovar I, also known as Actinomyces naeslundiigenospecies 1. Cells of Actinomyces naeslundii are usuallydiphtheroidal showing some branching (Figure 5) and/orarrangement in Y, V, or T forms. Microcolonies may be highlyfilamentous (Figure 14), but may also show the result of earlyfragmentation leading to less to non-filamentous colonyforms. Mature colonies are either smooth or finely granular(Figure 28) and circular, or they may show branching filaments in the periphery of the colony (Figure 29) or evenpresent as a molar-tooth colony (Figure 30). Their diametermay be greater than 2 mm. Catalase-negative. Additionalmorphological details, ultrastructure, cell-wall composition,nutrition and growth conditions, metabolism and metabolicpathways as well as drug susceptibility are as given for thegenus and as summarized in Table 7. Physiological andother descriptive and differential characteristics are listedin Table 1 and Table 3. Actinomyces naeslundii can reliably bedifferentiated from the closely related species of the formerActinomyces naeslundii/Actinomyces viscosus complex on thebasis of sequence comparison of partial gene sequences ofatpA and metG. A clear-cut distinction from Actinomyces orisand Actinomyces johnsonii is as yet not possible by phenotypictesting. After emendation of the species, it appears to beserologically homogeneous. The normal habitat of Actinomyces naeslundii is the oral cavity of man including tonsillarcrypts and dental plaque. It was found to account for 7.6% ofthe human healthy periodontal flora and occurred in 54.6%of the samples examined. The respective figures for patientswith gingivitis and periodontitis were 2.7% and 30.7%. Thespecies may also be detected in cervicovaginal secretionsfrom women using and not using IUCDs. Human infectionsdue to Actinomyces naeslundii most frequently present ascervicofacial, thoracic, or abdominal actinomycotic lesionsclinically indistinguishable from those produced by Actinomyces israelii or Actinomyces gerencseriae although some ofthe reports blaming Actinomyces naeslundii as causative agentmight have been biased by mixed infections with Actinomycesisraelii or Actinomyces gerencseriae or by contamination of thespecimen from mucosal secretions. However, eye infections(e.g., lacrimal canaliculitis) and infections of the femalegenital tract as well as gallbladder infections, pelvic infections, mediastinal actinomycosis, a disseminated infectionin a mentally retarded child, a recurring empyema of theknee joint, and infections of a total knee arthroplasty anda hip prosthesis have also been reported. Furthermore, thespecies obviously plays an important role in the complexetiology and pathogenesis of caries and periodontitis. Afterparenteral inoculation, Actinomyces naeslundii was foundto cause abscess formation in experimental animals. Afteroral inoculation, the organism is apparently able to initiate periodontitis with alveolar bone loss and/or fissurelesions in hamsters and conventional as well as gnotobioticrats.Source (type strain): human sinus secretions.DNA G+C content (mol%): 63 (Tm).Type strain: ATCC 12104, CCUG 2238, CCUG 18310,CCUG 32832, CCUG 35333, CDC W826, CIP 103128, DSM43013, JCM 8349, NCTC 10301.Sequence accession no.

Cellular and colonial morphology resemble those described for Actinomycesnaeslundii (Figure 31) although less filamentous formspredominate (Figure 15 and Figure 32). Quite often,smooth, entire, and soft colonies are seen (Figure 27)which resemble those of propionibacteria. Catalase may ormay not be produced. Additional morphological details,chemotaxonomic properties, nutrition and growth conditions, and metabolism are as given for the genus and assummarized in Table 7. Physiological and other descriptiveor differential characteristics are listed in Table 1 and Table 3.However, morphological and physiological properties usuallydo not suffice for reliable identification. The latter can beachieved by sequence comparison of partial gene sequencesof atpA or metG. As the species Actinomyces oris contains strainsformerly classified as Actinomyces naeslundii serovars II, III,and NV and Actinomyces viscosus serovar II, it must be antigenically heterogeneous, but the definite antigenic structureof the new species remains to be described. The normalhabitat of Actinomyces oris is the oral cavity of man. It accountsfor 8.3% of the healthy periodontal flora and was detectedin 79.8% of the samples examined. The respective figuresfor patients with gingivitis and periodontitis were 8.2% and77.4%. Actinomyces oris has obviously also been recovered fromcervicovaginal secretions of women with or without IUCDsand from the uninfected conjunctiva and/or cornea of man.Occasionally, Actinomyces oris (Actinomyces viscosus serovar II)has been isolated from cervicofacial and abdominal cases ofhuman actinomycoses and at least in some of these cases,Actinomyces oris appeared to be the primary pathogen. Furthermore, the species may be involved in the etiology oflacrimal canaliculitis and other eye infections and possiblyalso in the etiology of cervicitis and endometritis of womenusing IUCDs. Among the members of the genus Actinomyces,Actinomyces oris represents a species whose contribution to thedevelopment of caries and periodontitis has been establishedconvincingly.

DMBP00001936	Aeromonas veroniiHickman-Brenner, MacDonald, Steigerwalt, Fanning,Brenner and Farmer 1988b, 220VP (Effectivepublication: Hickman-Brenner, MacDonald,Steigerwalt, Fanning, Brenner and Farmer 1987, 901.)...................................................................................ve.ro’ ni.i. M.L. gen. n. veronii of Véron, named after M.M.Véron.Hybridization Groups 8/10 of 17 (Popoff et al., 1981;Farmer et al., 1986).Subsequent to the proposal for this species (formerlytermed Enteric Group 77 and HG 10), it was learned thatalthough they had different biochemical reactions, HG 8 wasgenetically identical to HG 10. Thus, A. veronii contained twobiogroups (Kuijper et al., 1989a; Altwegg et al., 1990). Thefirst was the originally proposed ornithine decarboxylasepositive species, A. veronii (HG 10) (Hickman-Brenner et al.,1987). The second group was lysine decarboxylase positive,arginine dihydrolase positive, and ornithine decarboxylasenegative, and contained the so-called “clinical” A. sobria (HG8). While the HG 7 environmental strains of A. sobria and theformer HG 8 A. sobria are phenotypically very similar, theyare genetically and clinically quite different. For this reason,it was decided to place the two biogroups of A. veronii intotwo separate biovars, namely biovar veronii and biovar sobria(Joseph et al., 1991).The mol% G+C of the DNA is: undetermined.Type strain: ATCC 35624, DSM 7386.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA): X74684.Note that the species name Aeromonas ichthiosmia (Schubert et al., 1990b) has been validly published, but has beenunarguably shown to be identical to A. veronii (Carnahan,1992; Collins et al., 1993, Huys et al., 2001) (see Taxonomic Comments).10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01081

Does not produce β-hemolysis on sheep blood agar(SBA) (5%). There is no growth at 42∘C. Produces gas fromglucose at 25∘C and no gas at 37∘C after 48 h. This speciesclosely resembles A. veronii biovar sobria (HG 8) biochemically, although they differ in their arginine dihydrolase andhemolytic reaction (SBA) (Table 7) and their ability to grow at42∘C. Other differences include the ability of A. sobria to produce a positive string test (with 0.5% sodium desoxycholate)and susceptibility to O129 (150 μg). Differential tests to aid inthe identification of A. sobria from all motile species are listedin Table 7.

They may occur singly, in pairs or in small clumps. Grows poorly in ambient air, but well in 5 % CO2. Colonies on chocolate agar are small, with a diameter of ⩽0.5 mm after 24 h, but may exceed 1–2 mm after 48 h. On primary isolation, the colonies are rough-textured and adherent and have an internal, opaque pattern described as star-like or like ‘crossed cigars’. The rough phenotype is related to fimbriation and to the production of hexoseamine-containing exopolysaccharide. Cells from rough colonies grow in broth as granular, autoaggregated cells that adhere to the glass and leave a clear broth. Successive rounds of subculturing in vitro on solid media can result in transformation into a smooth, non-adherent colony type that exhibits planktonic growth in broth and reduced ability to colonize the mouth of experimental animals. X and V factors are not required. Acid is produced from glucose, fructose, maltose and mannose, whereas arabinose, cellobiose, galactose, lactose, melibiose, melezitose, trehalose, raffinose, salicin, sorbitol and sucrose are not fermented. Variable fermentation is observed with mannitol and xylose. Catalase-positive; ONPG is not hydrolysed. Secretes a leukotoxin of the highly conserved repeat toxin (RTX) family. Six serotypes a–f have been described. Key tests for discrimination between Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and V factor-independent strains of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus are catalase and ONPG, plus fermentation of lactose, sucrose and trehalose.Indigenous to man, with primary habitat on dental surfaces. A particular clone of serotype b with enhanced leukotoxic activity is predominantly associated with cases of localized aggressive periodontitis. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has regularly been isolated together with Actinomyces species from human actinomycosis. It is sometimes found in other pathological processes such as endocarditis, brain abscess and urinary tract infections. The G+C content of the DNA is 42.7 mol% (T m).The type strain is NCTC 9710T=ATCC 33384T=CCUG 13227T=CIP 52.106T=DSM 8324T. The GenBank accession number of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain is M75039.10.1099/ijs.0.64207-0
DMBP00001944	Aggregatibacter (Ag.gre.ga.ti.bac′ter. L. v. aggregare to come together, aggregate, N.L. masc. n. bacter bacterial rod, N.L. masc. n. Aggregatibacter rod-shaped bacterium that aggregates with others).A member of the family Pasteurellaceae. Gram-negative, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic rods or coccobacilli. Growth is mesophilic. Several species of the genus are capnophilic and primary isolation may require the presence of 5–10 % CO2. There is no dependence on X factor and the requirement for V factor is variable. Granular growth in broth is common. Colonies on sheep- and horse-blood agar are greyish white and non-Haemolytic. Acid is produced from glucose, fructose and maltose, whereas arabinose, cellobiose, melibiose, melezitose, salicin and sorbitol are not attacked. The fermentation of galactose, lactose, mannitol, mannose, raffinose, sorbose, sucrose, trehalose and xylose is variable and may aid in identification to the species level. Nitrate is reduced. Alkaline phosphatase is produced, but strains are negative in tests for indole, urease, ornithine and lysine decarboxylases and arginine dihydrolase. Oxidase reaction is negative or weak; catalase is variably present. IgA1 protease is not expressed. The species of the genus are intimately associated with man; they are part of the human oral flora and are occasionally recovered from other body sites, including blood and brain, as causes of endocarditis and abscesses. The type species is Aggregatibacteractinomycetemcomitans, originally described as ‘Bacterium actinomycetem comitans’ by Klinger (1912).Aggregatibacter aphrophilus (aph.ro′phi.lus. Gr. n. aphros foam; Gr. adj. philos loving; N.L. adj. aphrophilus foam loving).Basonym: Haemophilus aphrophilus Khairat 1940.Short, regular rods, 0.5×1.5–1.7 μm, with occasional filamentous forms. Colonies on chocolate agar incubated in air supplemented with 5–10 % extra CO2 are high-convex, granular, yellowish and opaque and reach a diameter of 1.0–1.5 mm within 24 h. When plates are incubated without extra CO2, the growth is characteristically stunted, with very small colonies interspersed with a few larger colonies. Growth in broth is granular, with heavy sediment on the bottom of the tube and adhering colonies on the walls, which are difficult to remove. The presence of haemin may enhance growth, but porphyrins are synthesized from δ-aminolaevulinic acid and X factor is not required. Some isolates are capable of synthesizing NMN from nicotinamide and 5-phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (formerly Haemophilus aphrophilus), while others lack a functional nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase and are dependent on V factor (formerly Haemophilus paraphrophilus). Acid is produced from glucose, fructose, lactose, maltose, mannose, sucrose and trehalose, whereas arabinose, cellobiose, mannitol, melibiose, melezitose, salicin, sorbose, sorbitol and xylose are not fermented. Variable fermentation is observed with galactose and raffinose. H2O2 is not decomposed; ONPG is hydrolysed. Key tests for discrimination between V factor-dependent isolates of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus and strains of H. parainfluenzae biotype V (negative for indole, urease and ornithine decarboxylase) are fermentation of lactose and trehalose.Aggregatibacter aphrophilus is a member of the normal flora of the human oral cavity and pharynx. May cause brain abscess and infective endocarditis and has been isolated from various other body sites including peritoneum, pleura, wound and bone. The G+C content of the DNA is 42 mol% (T m).The type strain is NCTC 5906T=ATCC 33389T=CCUG 3715T=CIP 70.73T.

Strains produce acidfrom mannitol and grow on 2% NaCl (Bouzar et al.,1995). Strains can be differentiated from those of oneor more of the other four Agrobacterium species bytheir ability to metabolize the carbon substrates Nacetyl D-glucosamine, gentiobiose, m-inositol, lactulose, mono-methyl succinate, DL-lactic acid, D-saccharic acid, glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate and by their inability to metabolize Tween 40, Tween 80, i-erythritol, α-lactose, D-raffinose, acetic acid, citric acid, D-glucosaminic acid, malonic acid, succinamic acid, alaninamide, hydroxy-L-proline and L-pyroglutamic acid. A key characteristic that differentiates this species from other agrobacteria is its inability to metabolize cis-aconitic acid. The type strain of A. larrymoorei is AF3.10T (=ATCC 51759=CFBP 5473=NCPPB 4096T).10.1099/00207713-51-3-1023
DMBP00001946	Rods 0.6–1.0 × 1.5–3.0 μm, occurring singly or in pairs. Nonsporeforming. Gram negative. Motile by 1–4 peritrichous flagella. Aerobic, possessing a strictly respiratory type of metabolism with oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Some strains are capable of anaerobic respiration in the presence of nitrate. Most strains are able to grow under reduced oxygen tensions in plant tissues. Optimal temperature for growth: 25–28∘C. Colonies are usually convex, circular, smooth, nonpigmented to light beige. Growth on carbohydrate-containing media is usually accompanied by copious extracellular polysaccharide slime.Catalase positive. Usually oxidase positive and urease positive. Indole is not produced. Chemoorganotrophs, utilizing a wide range of carbohydrates, salts of organic acids, and amino acids as carbon sources, but not cellulose, starch, agar, or chitin. Produce an acid reaction in mineral salts media containing mannitol and other carbohydrates. Ammonium salts and nitrates can serve as nitrogen sources for strains of some species; others require amino acids and additional growth factors. 3-ketoglycosides are produced by the majority of strains belonging to A. tumefaciens. Strains of some species in this genus invade the crown, roots, and stems of a great variety of dicotyledonous and some gymnospermous plants via wounds, causing transformation of the plant cells into autonomously proliferating tumor cells. Oncogenicity is correlated with the presence of a large tumor-inducing plasmid.Habitat: soil. Oncogenic strains occur mainly in soils previously contaminated with diseased plant material.Some non-oncogenic Agrobacterium strains have been isolated from human clinical specimens.The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 57–63.Type species: Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Smith and Townsend 1907) Conn 1942, 359AL (Bacterium tumefaciens Smith and Townsend 1907, 672; Agrobacterium radiobacter (Beijerinck and van Delden 1902) Conn1942, 359; Agrobacterium radiobacter biovar radiobacter (Beijerinck and van Delden 1902) Keane, Kerr and New 1970, 594; Agrobacterium radiobacter biovar tumefaciens (Smith and Townsend 1907) Keane, Kerr and New 1970, 594; Agrobacterium radiobacter pathovar tumefaciens (Smith and Townsend 1907) Young, Dye, Bradbury, Panagopoulos and Robbs 1978, 156.)10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00842

Cells are Gram-negative, motile or non-motile rods. Oxidase- and catalase-positive. The requirement for NaCl for growth is dependent on the species. Hydrolyse gelatin, but are unable to produce indole, urease, β-galactosidase or arginine dihydrolase. Do not grow at temperatures of 17 °C or less. The DNA G+C content is 49.5–51.0 mol%.

The strain was oxidase and catalase positive. The strain grew optimally at pH 10, NaCl concentration of 3.5% at 37°C. The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, anteiso-C15:0, and iso-C17:0. The peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP). Phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylglycerol were the major polar lipids of MEB199T. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain MEB199T belonged to the family Bacillaceae and exhibited a distinctive position among the members of the genus Alkalihalobacillus (Ahb.). Strain MEB199T shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Alkalihalobacillus alkalinitrilicus ANL-iso4T (98.36%), whereas with type species Ahb. alcalophilus DSM 485T, it is 94.91%, indicating that strain MEB199T is distinctly related to the genus Alkalihalobacillus. The G + C content of genomic DNA was 36.47 mol%. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) (23.6%) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) (81%) values between strain MEB199T and Ahb. alkalinitrilicus ANL-iso4T confirmed the novelty of this new species. The pairwise identity based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence between the species of genus Alkalihalobacillus ranges from 87.4 to 99.81% indicating the heterogeneity in the genus. The different phylogenetic analysis based on the genome showed that the members of the genus Alkalihalobacillus separated into eight distinct clades. The intra-clade average amino acid identity (AAI) and percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) range from 52 to 68% and 37 to 59%, respectively, which are interspersed on the intra-genera cutoff values; therefore, we reassess the taxonomy of genus Alkalihalobacillus. The phenotypic analysis also corroborated the differentiation between these clades. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, genomic indices, and phenotypic traits, we propose the reclassification of the genus Alkalihalobacillus into seven new genera for which the names Alkalihalobacterium gen. nov., Halalkalibacterium gen. nov., Halalkalibacter gen. nov., Shouchella gen. nov., Pseudalkalibacillus gen. nov., Alkalicoccobacillus gen. nov., and Alkalihalophilus gen. nov. are proposed and provide an emended description of Alkalihalobacillus sensu stricto. Also, we propose the Ahb. okuhidensis as a heterotypic synonym of Alkalihalobacillus halodurans. Based on the polyphasic taxonomic analysis, strain MEB199T represents a novel species of newly proposed genus for which the name Alkalihalobacterium elongatum gen. nov. sp. nov. is proposed.

Most species are aerobic, but some members are facultatively anaerobic. All studied members, except Alkalihalobacillus okhensis, are reported to form endospores. Isolated from diverse environments including soil, hypersaline lakes and marine coastal regions. Most species exhibit motility generally through peritrichous flagella, but some are reported to be nonmotile. The majority of species from this genus are alkaliphilic and halotolerant or halophilic and they grow in the pH range between 6–11, with optimal growth occurring around pH 9–10 in the presence of 1–5 % NaCl. Some species are obligately alkaliphilic requiring highly alkaline pH for growth. Growth occurs in the range 4–45 °C, with optimum growth temperature in the range 25–37 °C. Several species from this genus are of considerable industrial interest due to their production of enzymes such as cellulases, proteases for inclusion in laundry detergents, xylanases for use in the pulp paper industry and cyclodextrin glucanotransferase for manufacture of cyclodextrin from starch. Include species (Alkalihalobacillus rhizosphaerae), which are diazotrophic and can fix atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia and other species such as Alkalihalobacillus clausii, which exhibit probiotic activity due to production of antimicrobial compounds. Members of this genus form a monophyletic clade in phylogenetic trees based on concatenated sequences for different large datasets of proteins. Additionally, the members of this genus can be reliably distinguished from all other Bacillaceae species by the 10 CSIs described in Table 5 found in the following proteins, viz. RNase adapter RapZ, flagellar basal body M-ring protein FliF, 7-carboxy-7-deazaguanine synthase QueE, peptide chain release factor 3, type I glutamate--ammonia ligase, tRNA threonyl-carbamoyladenosine dehydratase, transcription-repair coupling factor, tRNA uridine-5-carboxymethylaminomethyl (34) synthesis enzyme MnmG, 50S ribosomal protein L11 methyltransferase, and homoserine kinase, which in most cases are exclusively shared by either all or most members of this genus.The type species is Alkalihalobacillus alcalophilus.10.1099/ijsem.0.003775

DMBP00002001	Bacillus anthracis Cohn 1872, 177ALan’thra.cis. Gr. n. anthrax charcoal, a carbuncle; N.L.n. anthrax the disease anthrax; N.L. gen. n. anthracis of anthrax.Phenotypically similar to Bacillus cereus (see below and Table 8) except in the characters undernoted. Colonies of Bacillus anthracis (Figure 2a) are similar to those of Bacillus cereus, but those of the former are generally smaller, non-hemolytic, may show more spiking or tailing along the lines of inoculation streaks, and are very tenacious as compared with the usually more butyrous consistency of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis colonies, so that they may be pulled into standing peaks with a loop. Nonmotile. Usually susceptible to penicillin. Susceptible to gamma phage (see Logan and Turnbull, 2003, Logan et al., 2007). Produces a glutamyl-polypeptide capsule in vivo and when grown on nutrient agar containing 0.7% sodium bicarbonate incubated overnight under 5–7% CO2. Colonies of the capsulate Bacillus anthracis appear mucoid, and the capsule can be visualized by staining smears with M’Fadyean’s polychrome methylene blue or India Ink (Turnbull et al., 1998). An isolate showing the characteristic phenotype but unable to produce capsules may be an avirulent form lacking either or both capsule or toxin genes (Turnbull et al., 1992). Virulent and avirulent strains may be distinguished from other members of the Bacillus cereus group using tests in the API System (Logan et al., 1985). Virulence genes are carried by plasmidspX01 (toxins) and pX02 (capsule); these plasmids may be transmissible to other members of the Bacillus cereus group (Turnbull et al., 2002). Primer sequences are now available for confirming the presence of the toxin and capsule genes, and hence the virulence of an isolate. Genetically very closely related to Bacillus cereus and other members of the Bacillus cereus group (Turnbull, 1999); Bacillus anthracis may be distinguished from other members of the Bacillus cereus group by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis (Keim et al., 2000; Turnbull et al., 2002). A 277bp DNA sequence (Ba813) has been described as a specific chromosomal marker for Bacillus anthracis and in combination with sequencing of parts of lef and cap genes its sequence allows the identification of virulent strains (application note 209 of Pyrosequencing AB). Isolates of Bacillus anthracis show considerable molecular homogeneity, and the species may derive from a relatively recent common ancestor.Causative agent of the disease anthrax in herbivorous and other animals and man. Widely studied and developed as a biological weapon. Generally considered to be an obligate pathogen; if it ever multiplies in the environment, it probably only does so rarely. Spores remain viable in soil for many years and their persistence does not depend on animal reservoirs.Source: blood of animals and humans suffering from anthrax, from anthrax carcasses, and from animal products and soil contaminated with spores of the organism.DNA G + C content (mol%): 32.2–33.9 (Tm) for five strains, and 33.2 (Tm) for the type strain.Type strain: Vollum strain, ATCC 14578, NCIB 9377, NCTC 10340.The 16S rRNA (or rDNA) gene sequence of the type strain is not available in the EMBL/GenBank database.However, 16S rDNA sequences of 98 strains of this species in EMBL are nearly all identical. Accession number AF176321 corresponds with the strain “Sterne.”10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00530

DMBP00002016	AbstractA facultatively anaerobic, Gram-stain-positive, spore-forming Bacillus strain, 17-SMS-01T, isolated from spent mushroom substrate in the Fangshan District, Beijing, PR China, was initially identified as a Bacillus cereus group species based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Strain 17-SMS-01T had the highest sequence similarities to Bacillus wiedmannii FSL W8-0169T (99.9 %), Bacillus albus N35-10-2T (99.9 %), Bacillus luti TD41T (99.9 %) and Bacillus proteolyticus TD42T (99.9 %). However, the average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values between strain 17-SMS-01T and the most closely related species were less than the previously proposed cut-off values of 96 % (ANI) and 70 % (DDH) for differentiating species within the genus, suggesting that this strain represents a novel Bacillus group species. The fatty acid profile of strain 17-SMS-01T, which showed a predominance of iso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C15 : 0, supported the allocation of the strain to the genus Bacillus. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7 (100%). The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl glycerol, an unidentified aminophospholiped and unidentified lipids. The DNA G+C content of the novel strain was 35.0 mol%. The results of physiological and biochemical tests also allowed the phenotypic differentiation of strain 17-SMS-01T from the most closely related recognized species. On the basis of the phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, strain 17-SMS-01T represents a novel Bacillus species, for which the name Bacillus fungorum sp. nov. is proposed.

DMBP00002018	AbstractTwo independent isolates of a Gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic, motile, rod-shaped bacterium were recovered from cheonggukjang, a Korean fermented soybean paste food product. Preliminary sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that these strains were related most closely to Bacillus sonorensis KCTC-13918T and Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13T. In phenotypic characterization, the novel strains were found to grow between 15 and 55 °C and to tolerate up to 8 % (w/v) NaCl. Furthermore, the strains grew in media of pH 5-10 (optimal growth at pH 7.0). The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0 and iso-C15 : 0.The isoprenoid quinone was menaquinone 7 (MK-7). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unknown glycolipid. Draft genomes of the two strains were determined and in silico DNA-DNA hybridizations with their nearest neighbour (B. sonorensis KCTC-13918T) revealed 29.9 % relatedness for both strains. Phylogenomic analysis of the genomes was conducted with the core genome (799 genes) of all strains in the Bacillus subtilis group and the two strains formed a distinct monophyletic cluster. In addition, the strains differed from the two most closely related species in that they did not metabolize maltose, d-galactose, d-sorbitol or d-gluconic acid. The DNA G+C content was 45.9 mol%. Based upon the consensus of phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses, these strains represent a novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus glycinifermentans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GO-13T ( = KACC 18425T = NRRL B-65291T).10.1099/ijsem.0.000462

DMBP00002044	AbstractThree Gram-positive bacterial strains, BML-BC004, BML-BC017 and BML-BC059, isolated from blood samples from three inpatients in Japan, were identified as members of Bacillus cereus using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of these three strains were more than 97.1 % similar to 18 type strains belonging to the B. cereus group. Whole-genome comparisons, using average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), confirmed that the three strains represented three individual distinct species belonging to the B. cereus group. A phylogenetic tree showed that BML-BC004, BML-BC017 and BML-BC059 were located close to B. luti, B. mobilis and B. paramycoides, respectively. Based on these phylogenetic and phenotypic data, including values below the threshold for ANI and dDDH, the three strains should be classified as representing three different novel species of the B. cereus group: Bacillus sanguinis sp. nov., with type strain BML-BC004T (=DSM 111102T=JCM 34122T), Bacillus paramobilis sp. nov., with type strain BML-BC017T (=DSM 111100T=JCM 34124T) and Bacillus hominis sp. nov., with type strain BML-BC059T (=DSM 111101T=JCM 34125T).Keywords: Bacillus cereus group; human pathogen.10.1099/ijsem.0.004993

L. masc. part. adj. aggregatus added to, joinedtogether, referring to the tendency to form coccoid aggregates.Gram-stain-positive actinobacterium. Highly irregular vibroid or rod-shaped cells occurring singly or inthree-dimensional coccoid aggregates, depending onenvironmental conditions. Low salt concentrations, temperatures of 5–10∘C, and microaerophilic conditions favorthe motile rod stage. Single cells are either motile vibroids(0.3–1.5 × 0.4–3.0 μm) or rods or ellipsoid (1.2–1.5 ×1.5–3.0 μm); rods are often separated by disk-like septa.These motile or nonmotile rods carry 1–6 vibrioformbuds, attached by a tapered pole onto the mother cell.Increased temperature and salt concentrations induce theformation of nonmotile coccoid aggregates (1.2–2.5 μm indiameter), appearing as linear, band-like, or column-likethree-dimensional forms. Larger aggregates (1 mm indiameter) are separated by rectangular and/or radialpartitions. Cell types of different sizes occur mostly sideby side. After 5 days on peptone–yeast extract agar at20∘C, colonies are pink, turbid, round, and convex withshiny surfaces. In liquid media, thin turbidity and formation of pink sediment are observed. Growth was observedbetween 10 and 40∘C. Catalase-positive, oxidase-negative.Degradation of starch, chitin, alginate, or cellulose is notproduced. No growth is observed in mineral medium; weakgrowth is seen in the presence of ethanol, but not withglucose, acetate, citrate, methanol, ethylamine, or paraffin.Good growth is observed in mineral medium plus peptone(0.5%) and yeast extract (0.1%); in these media, additionof glucose, acetate, citrate, ethylamine, or paraffin (at 1%)reduces growth.

DMBP00002134	AbstractSeven strains of symbiotic bacteria from root nodules of local races of Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea) and peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) grown on subsistence farmers' fields in the Kavango region, Namibia, were previously characterized and identified as a novel group within the genus Bradyrhizobium. To corroborate their taxonomic status, these strains were further characterized using a polyphasic approach. All strains possessed identical 16S rRNA gene sequences with Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense CCBAU 10071T being the most closely related type strain in the 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis, and Bradyrhizobium daqingense CCBAU 15774T in the ITS sequence analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated glnII-recA-rpoB-dnaK placed the strains in a highly supported lineage distinct from named species of the genus Bradyrhizobium, most closely related to Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense CCBAU 10071T. The species status was validated by results of DNA–DNA hybridization. Phylogenetic analysis of nifH genes placed the novel strains in a group with nifH of ‘Bradyrhizobium arachidis’ CCBAU 051107 that also nodulates peanuts. The combination of phenotypic characteristics from several tests including carbon source utilization and antibiotic resistance could be used to differentiate representative strains from recognized species of the genus Bradyrhizobium. Novel strain 58 2-1T induced effective nodules on V. subterranea, Vigna unguiculata and A. hypogaea, and some strains on Lablab purpureus. Based on the data presented, we conclude that our strains represent a novel species for which the name Bradyrhizobium subterraneum sp. nov. is proposed, with 58 2-1T [ = DSM 100298T = LMG 28792T = NTCCM0016T (Windhoek)] as the type strain. The DNA G+C content of strain 58 2-1T was 64.7 mol% (T m).10.1099/ijsem.0.000403

DMBP00002216	Description and discussion of Flavobacterium indologenes sp. nov. F. indologenes (in · do · lo’ ge · nes. M.L. neut. n. indolum indole; Gr. v. gennaio to produce; N.L. adj. indologenes indole producing) cells are straight rods 0.5 by 1.3 to 2.5 μm when the organism is grown on solid agar medium. In broth culture, many long, thread-like cells are present. Nonmotile and asporogenous. Colonies on heart infusion agar after 20 h of incubation at 30°C are 1 mm in diameter and have smooth surfaces and entire margins. Colonies of some strains become rhizoid within 20 h. Colonies on any medium are deep orange due to intracellular pigments of the flexirubin type, which are present from the very beginning of the appearance of colonies. The visible absorption spectra of the orange pigments in acetone and in alkalinized acetone are shown in Fig. 3.Growth on a plate of motility medium (0.3% agar) spreads like a dahlia flower and almost covers the medium in a petri dish (diameter, 9 cm) within 20 h at room temperature (Fig. 5a). The spreading growth on 0.5% agar medium in a petri dish is moderate, and almost no spreading occurs on 1% agar medium. The cells are arranged in a monolayer at the edge of the spreading growth on 0.5% agar medium (Fig. 5b). Young cultures of many strains have a strong fruity odor similar to that of F. odoratum.Chemoorganotrophic. Luxurious growth is produced on ordinary peptone media, but no growth is produced in standard mineral base medium (12) supplemented with glucose and ammonium sulfate as the sole sources of carbon and nitrogen. Nearly 50% of the strains are inhibited on MacConkey agar (Nissui). Metabolism is respiratory and not fermentative. This organism can grow under anaerobic conditions in the presence of fumarate. Some strains reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas; other strains reduce neither nitrate nor nitrite. Catalase, indophenol oxidase, amylase, DNase, gelatinase, lipase, and tryptophanase are produced. On egg yolk agar a clear zone around colonies is produced within 20 h; upon continued incubation this zone becomes increasingly turbid, and a grayish white halo is produced in the medium. Acid is produced oxidatively from fructose, glucose, glycogen, maltose, mannose, and trehalose, but not from d-arabinose, rhamnose, ribose, xylose, galactose, cellobiose, lactose, melibiose, sucrose, raffinose, melezitose , adonitol , dulcitol, inulin, or salicin. Urease, acylamidase, phenylalanine deaminase, lysine decarboxylase, arginine dihydrolase, and ornithine decarboxylase are not produced. The major biochemical characteristics of F. indologenes, F. meningosepticum, and other organisms used in this study are summarized in Table 6. Selected characteristics that are useful for differentiating F. indologenes among the five Flavobacterium species are also shown in Table 6. Table 8 shows the variable characteristics among the 13 strains of F. indologenes studied.Four major components of the cellular fatty acids of strain GIFU 1347T are i-C15:0, i-C17:1, i-3-OH-C17:0, and i-2-OH-C15:0 (Table 4). The G+ C content of the DNA is 37.7 mol%.The type strain is ATCC 17898 (= CDC 3716 = GIFU 1347 = NCTC 10796).Although this species as currently described represents a genetically rather heterogenous group of organisms, it is assigned a proper scientific name with a detailed description, both for convenience and to encourage further taxonomic research on the genus Flavobacterium.

Chavda et al 7. determined groups for the E. cloacae complex using SNPs from whole genome alignments. ANI analysis showed that the Chavda groups were highly similar at levels associated with species or subspecies groupings. Enterobacter roggenkampii sp. nov. is the type strain for Hoffmann cluster IV and Chavda group M. This paper performs a more detailed analysis of gene content and ANI across a larger set of genomes supporting the Chavda groups A-R and adding S-V. E. roggenkampii sp. nov. has similar gene content and ANI characteristics as previously defined species in the E. cloacae complex.Hoffmann deposited the type strain, EN-117, for Enterobacter roggenkampii in Leibniz-Institut DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, accession DSM-16690, and recently the strain was also deposited in BCCM/LMG Bacteria Collection, accession LMG-30172.

DMBP00002219	This description is based on phylogenetic analysesof partial hsp60 sequence data collected in arecent population genetic study [12] as well as onDNA–DNA-hybridization assays and phenotypic char-acterizations performed in the frame of the presentstudy. Phenotypic characterization was performed usingAPI20E, Biotype 100, and a series of conventional tests.E. ludwigii strains are gram-negative rods, which aremotile, catalase positive, oxidase and DNAase negative,fermentative, and non-pigmented. They exhibit thegeneral characteristics of the family Enterobacteriaceae,the genus Enterobacter, and the E. cloacae complex.Growth occurs after 18–24 h at 15–42 1C with anoptimum at 36 1C on all non-selective media likeColumbia agar with 5% sheep-blood, chocolate-, TSA-, Luria–Bertani-, or Brain–Heart agar as well as onsemi-selective media like MacConkey- or ENDO-agar innon-pigmented colonies. A detailed biochemical profil-ing of the species is given in Table 3. Table 4 shows testsin use for differentiating E. ludwigii from the otherspecies of the genus. Its identification is mainly possibleby the ability to grow on 3-0-methyl- D -gluco-pyranoseand on myo-inositol. All strains analysed produced aBush class 1 beta-lactamase rendering resistance toampicillin, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid and cefoxitinin the disk diffusion tests performed. 20% of straindisplayed a resistance pattern typical for AmpC hyper-production (resistance to piperacillin, piperacillin plustazobactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, andsusceptibility to cefepime). All strains were susceptibleto trimethoprim plus sulphamethoxazole, gentamicin,meropenem and ciprofloxacin.The type strain EN-119 T ( ¼ DSM 16688 T ¼ CIP108491 T ) was isolated from mid-stream urine of an 18-year old male patient with a nosocomial urinary tractinfection, while he was hospitalized at the Grosshadern-University-Hospital Munich, Germany.

DMBP00002221	Biochemical characteristics between strains WCHECL1060T and 090040 and type strains of other Enterobacter species are shown in Table 4. For both strains, growth occurs at 4 to 37°C with optimal growth at 35 and 37°C, but not at 45 or 50°C. Cells grow at 35°C in the presence of 0 to 9% (wt/vol) NaCl in tryptic soy broth (TSB). Both strains were positive for the catalase test but negative for oxidase activity. Cells of the two strains are Gram negative, motile, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic, and rod shaped. Colonies are circular, white, translucent, raised, and smooth after 24 h of incubation at 35°C on nutrient agar. Acid is produced from glycerol, l-arabinose, d-ribose, d-xylose, d-galactose, d-glucose, sucrose, melibiose, amygdalin, d-fructose, d-mannose, l-rhamnose, inositol, d-mannitol, d-sorbitol, potassium 2-ketogluconate, and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside but not erythritol, l-xylose, d-adonitol, d-arabinose, potassium gluconate, and methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. Both strains have a positive reaction for β-galactosidase, arginine dihydrolase, and ornithine decarboxylase but are negative for lysine decarboxylase, deaminase, and gelatinase. Both are also negative for urease activity and indole production but positive for the Voges-Proskauer reaction. Both strains can utilize citrate but do not produce H2S. The two strains can be differentiated from all other Enterobacter species by their ability to ferment inositol, d-sorbitol, and melibiose but not potassium gluconate, l-fucose, and methyl-α-d-mannopyranoside.

N.L. gen. n. beijerinckii named for M.W. Beijerinck, Dutch bacteriologist.Cells in PYG broth culture are straight rods with roundedends, motile and peritrichous, 0.5–1.7 × 1.7–8.0 μm,occurring singly, in pairs, or in short chains. They areGram-stain-positive, becoming Gram-stain-negative in oldercultures. Spores are oval, eccentric to subterminal, and swellthe cell, with no exosporium or appendages. Sporulationoccurs readily on chopped-meat agar slants incubated at30 ∘C. Cell walls contain meso-DAP; cell-wall sugars are glucose and galactose. Surface colonies on blood agar platesare 1–5 mm, circular to irregular, entire to scalloped, flat toraised, translucent, gray, shiny, and smooth. Strains may beeither α, β, or nonhemolytic.Cultures in PYG broth are turbid with a smooth to flocculent sediment and have a pH of 4.6–5.4 after incubationfor 5 d.Optimum temperature for growth is 37 ∘C. Cultures growwell at 30 ∘C but poorly if at all at 25 ∘C or 45 ∘C. Growthis stimulated by a fermentable carbohydrate, inhibited by6.5% NaCl or 20% bile. Strains are nutritionally fastidious,requiring a complex mixture of growth factors such as aresupplied by yeast extract. Abundant gas is detected in deepcultures in PYG agar. Ammonia is produced by 10 of 40 strainstested. Neutral red is reduced; most strains reduce resazurin.Atmospheric N2 is fixed. Ammonium salts are utilized asthe sole N2 source to produce a wide variety of amino acidsincluding alanine, valine, aspartic acid, and threonine. Aneuraminidase is produced by strains of this species. Two ofthree strains tested produce an extracellular β-glucuronidase.The activity of a ferro-flavoprotein hydrogenase isolated fromone strain has been investigated. The emendation of Keiset al. (2001) included the ability to ferment sucrose and theability of the majority of the strains to utilize the alcohol sugars D- and L-arabitol, dulcitol, and inositol, but glycerol onlyweakly. All of the strains of Clostridium beijerinckii were alsoable to ferment methyl-glucopyranoside, turanose, dextrin,and pectin.Products in PYG broth are butyric and acetic, moderate amounts of succinic, lactic, and formic acids; tracesof propionic acid may also be detected. Although not astable trait, most strains produce substantial amounts ofn-butanol, and some produce moderate amounts of acetoneor 2-propanol. Pyruvate is converted to butyrate and acetate;neither threonine nor lactate is utilized. All strains testedare sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline. Of 21 strains,one is resistant to clindamycin, one to chloramphenicol,and one to penicillin G. Culture supernatants are nontoxicto mice.Other characteristics of the species are given in Table 3.Source: soil, infected wounds, fermenting olives, spoiledcandy, human feces.DNA G+C content (mol%): 26–28 (Tm).Type strain: ATCC 25752, CIP 104308, DSM 791, JCM 1390,LMG 5716, NCTC 13035.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA gene): X68179.Further comments: 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons show Clostridium beijerinckii to fall within the radiationof cluster I of the clostridia as defined by Collins et al.(1994).

This species is most easily differentiated fromClostridium butyricum which it resembles most closely phenotypically by its requirement for growth factors presentin yeast extract. Patterns of soluble cellular proteins ofthese two species, as determined by polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis, are distinct. Differential fermentation patterns are helpful but not absolute. Clostridium butyricumusually ferments ribose and glycerol but not inositol; Clostridium beijerinckii usually ferments inositol but not ribose orglycerol.10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00619
DMBP00002243	Clostridium perfringens*(Veillon and Zuber 1898) Hauduroy, Ehringer, Urbain, Guillot and Magrou 1937, 119AL (Bacillus perfringens Veillon and Zuber 1898, 539; “Bacterium welchii” Migula 1900, 392)...................................................................................per.frin’gens. L. part. adj. perfringens breaking through. This species produces a number of soluble substances that cause a variety of toxic effects in in vitro or in vivo conditions, or both. Clostridium perfringens has been divided into five types (A, B, C, D, and E) on the basis of production of major lethal toxins. Type A produces alpha toxin; type B produces alpha, beta, and epsilon toxins; type C produces alpha and beta toxins; type D alpha and epsilon toxins; type E produces alpha and iota toxins. A sixth type (type F) was proposed, but it is now considered type C, and type F designation has been abandoned. The five types of Clostridium perfringens cannot be differentiated reliably on the basis of cellular or colonial morphology, biochemical reactions, or gas-liquid-chromatographic analyses of fatty and organic acid end products of metabolism.This description, unless otherwise indicated, is based on study of strains representing the five types (A, B, C, D, and E) and 285 other strains.Cells in PYG broth culture are Gram-stain-positive, atrichous, nonmotile, straight rods with blunt ends, that occur singly or in pairs and are 0.6–2.4 × 1.3–19.0 μm. Spores are rarely seen in vivo or in the usual in vitro conditions; when present they are large, oval, central, or subterminal, and distend the cell. There is no exosporium and spores lack appendages. A complex relationship exists between previous heat treatment, the ability to ferment certain sugars, and the ability to sporulate. Spore yield is markedly increased by addition of various methylxanthines to the medium. Spores from heat-resistant strains usually require heat activation to germinate, whereas those from heat-susceptible strains do not; spores from heat-resistant strains are also more resistant to the lethal effects of gamma radiation.The cell wall contains LL-DAP; cell-wall sugars that may be present are galactose, glucose, and rhamnose; however, cell walls of different strains or types may not possess all three sugars. Approximately three-quarters of strains possess a capsule that is composed largely of polysaccharides; the composition of the capsular polysaccharide may vary among strains.Colonies on the surface of sheep blood agar are usually 2–5 mm in diameter, circular, entire, dome-shaped, gray to grayish yellow, and translucent with a glossy surface. Several other colonial morphologies (dwarfs, rough colonies with lobate margins, and flat colonies with an irregular surface and filamentous margins) occur occasionally, even in the same culture. The kind and extent of hemolysis present depends on both the species of blood and the type of Clostridium perfringens being examined; the three types of hemolysins that may be produced in varying quantities are designated alpha, delta, and theta. On rabbit, sheep, cow, horse, or human blood, most strains produce a narrow zone of complete hemolysis due to the theta toxin and a surrounding zone of incomplete hemolysis due to the alpha toxin. Some type B and C strains may produce a very wide zone of hemolysis on sheep or cow blood due to delta toxin. Synergistic hemolysis (CAMP phenomenon) between this species and Streptococcus agalactiae has been described. Colonies in agar are usuallylenticular.Cultures in PYG broth are turbid with a smooth or occasionally ropy sediment and have a pH of 4.8–5.6 after incubation for 1 week. The temperature for optimum growth oftypes A, D, and E is 45 ∘C; types B and C grow equally wellat 37 ∘C and 45 ∘C. The range of temperatures that will support growth of most strains is 20–50 ∘C; occasional strains will grow at 6 ∘C for a limited number of passages, but they are not truly psychrophilic. Growth is stimulated by the presence of a fermentable carbohydrate and is not inhibited by 20% bile. Growth occurs readily from pH 5.5–8.0. Growth is not inhibited by NaCl concentrations up to 2%, but is markedly inhibited by 6.5% NaCl. Growth is not enhanced by addition of CO2 to the atmosphere of incubation. Hyperbaric oxygen (100% oxygen at 3 atm) is bactericidal for this species; partial protection is conferred by addition of whole blood, presumably because of enzymic destruction of hydrogen peroxide by catalase. Abundant gas is produced in PYG deep agar cultures.Occasional strains weakly ferment glycerol, inulin, and sorbose; ammonia is produced; acetyl methyl carbinol and H2S are produced, and hippurate is hydrolyzed by some strains; neutral red is reduced; resazurin is reduced by most strains. Although more than 95% of strains ferment sucrose and produce lecithinase, an occasional isolate will be negative for one of these reactions. Deoxyribonuclease, acid phosphatase, ribonuclease, elastase, hyaluronidase, amylase, neuraminidase, a hemoagglutinin that is distinct from neuraminidase, exo-β-D-galactosidase, ferredoxin-linked nitrate reductase, and superoxide dismutase are produced by some or all strains. Bile acid metabolism includes deconjugation of taurocholic and glycocholic acids by types A, B, C, D, and E, degradation of chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, and conversion of a number of 3-α-hydroxy bile acids to 3-β-hydroxy and 3-oxo-bile acids. Occasional strains are reported to possess a Δ4-steroid dehydrogenase and/or the ability to cause aromatization of the Δ-ring of 4-androsten-3,17-dione; these steps have been postulatedto be important in converting steroids to colon carcinogens.Monoacetone glucose is fermented.Most strains are susceptible to bacteriocins produced by enterococci, particularly Streptococcus faecium. Some soil isolates of Clostridium perfringens produce inhibitors that are active against some or all of Clostridium botulinum types A, B, E, and F. Clostridium perfringens also produces bacteriocins that are active against other strains of Clostridium perfringens.Bacteriocin produced by one strain has a single-chained polypeptide with a molecular weight of approximately 82,000. The mechanism of action of many bacteriocins involves inhibition of macromolecular synthesis (DNA, RNA, and proteins); an additional (but undefined) mechanism probably also exists. Bacteriocin production and resistance to that bacteriocin by several strains have been shown to be related to the presence of a plasmid. Caseinase activity appears to be related to the presence of a plasmid in the one strain tested. Bacteriophages of this species have been recognized since 1949. Virulent bacteriophage has been recovered from sewage or river water below sewage discharge points. Some strains of types A, B, and C are lysogenic, whereas lysogeny has not been described for types D and E; in addition, smooth or rough strains usually are phage-susceptible whereas mucoid strains usually are resistant. The rapidity of sporulation and the percentage of spores that were heat-resistant decreased when one strain studied was cured of bacteriophage; these changes were reversed when the cured strain was reinfected with the temperate phage.Cultures of all five types, when grown in PYG broth, produce large amounts of acetic, butyric, and lactic acids; sometimes smaller amounts of propionic, formic, and succinic acids are detected. Abundant H2 is produced. Lactate occasionally is converted to butyrate; pyruvate is converted to acetate and butyrate and, occasionally, to formate; threonineis converted to propionate. The production of butyrate by one strain is abolished when nitrate was added to the medium. One strain of type E produces isovaleric acid and larger amounts of propionic acid in a medium containing monoacetone-glucose (rather than glucose). Two of four strains tested produce phenylacetic acid from a trypticase-yeast extract medium. Most β-lactams, particularly penicillin G, are quite active against Clostridium perfringens, but relatively greater resistance of this species to penicillin G has been reported. Chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and metronidazole are active against most isolates, but less so on a weight basis than is penicillin G; erythromycin and tetracycline are generallyless active than most of the penicillins, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and metronidazole. A number of strainsisolated from pig feces were reported to be resistant totetracycline, erythromycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin; thisdegree of resistance appeared to correlate with the use ofantimicrobial-containing animal feed. Aminoglycosides are inactive against Clostridium perfringens. Twelve of 25 strainswere inhibited by 0.25 mg or less of nalidixic acid/ml whereasthe remaining 13 strains required 4–64 μg/ml for inhibition. Plasmid-mediated resistance of Clostridium perfringens toclindamycin-erythromycin, to tetracycline-chloramphenicol,and to tetracycline alone has been described.Clostridium perfringens produces a variety of substances(often referred to as “exotoxins”) that have been suggestedas possible virulence factors. The four toxins alpha, beta,epsilon, and iota are often referred to as the major lethaltoxins. The alpha toxin is a phospholipase C that hydrolyzeslecithin to phosphorylcholine and a diglyceride; it is produced by all five types of Clostridium perfringens. Alpha toxinexerts its lethal effects by lysing cell membranes, presumablyas a consequence of hydrolysis of membrane lecithin. Thistoxin alone is the cause of muscle death in myonecrosisin cases of Clostridium perfringens gas gangrene in humansand other animals following trauma or abortion. The alphatoxin may also cause intravascular hemolysis. Several otherdiseases in animals are known or suspected to be causedby type A (presumably by the alpha toxin). These includea fatal enterotoxemia of lambs, newborn alpacas, captivewild goats, reindeer, and possibly chickens, and delayedhypersensitivity to alpha toxin in swine that results in arthritiswith eventual joint deformity, parakeratosis, and proliferativeglomerulonephritis. In addition to causing myonecrosisand/or intravascular hemolysis in humans via the alphatoxin, type A strains may also produce an enterotoxin thatcauses a food-poisoning syndrome in humans (see below).The beta toxin, produced by strains of types B and C, hasnot been completely characterized, but appears to be a highlytrypsin-sensitive, single chain polypeptide with a molecularmass of approximately 30,000. It appears to exert its toxiceffect by increasing capillary permeability. Intravenouslyadministered beta toxin appears to induce release of endogenous catecholamines. Beta toxin production is thoughtpossibly to be plasmid-mediated. The diseases producedby beta toxin involve the gastrointestinal tract. In humansa necrotic enteritis (pig-bel) develops soon after ingestionof roast pig that has been accidentally contaminated withfeces containing Clostridium perfringens type C; it is not knownwhether toxin is ingested or produced in the gut followingingestion of the organism. A necessary antecedent of pig-belappears to be ingestion of large quantities of sweet potatoeswhich contain a trypsin inhibitor. A similar form of necroticenteritis in humans (Darmbrand) was seen in Europe inthe mid- to late 1940s; in this setting the presence of starvation, which tends to produce low gastrointestinal levelsof trypsin, was probably an important cofactor. Type C alsocauses enterotoxemia or necrotic enteritis in lambs, calves,piglets, and sheep, whereas type B causes enterotoxemiaor necrotic enteritis in foals, lambs, sheep, and goats. Animportant cofactor for development of beta toxin-inducednecrotic enteritis in newborn or very young animals may bethe absence of trypsin in the gut.Epsilon toxin is elaborated by types B and D in the form ofa virtually nontoxic prototoxin that is converted to a potentheat-labile toxin by certain proteolytic enzymes such astrypsin. This toxin appears to increase vascular permeability,possibly by adenyl cyclase activation, that ultimately leads totissue necrosis. Exposure of the gut to epsilon toxin (to whichit is normally impervious) results in greater permeability toproteins, including epsilon toxin; this may be an importantfactor in pathogenesis of disease because oral administrationof a single large dose of epsilon toxin may be without effect,whereas administration of the same total dose in severalsmaller portions may be lethal. The toxin probably producesan increase in vascular permeability of many organs, the mostseriously affected of which is the brain; cerebral edema andnecrosis of brain tissue is the most likely cause of death inafflicted animals. The toxin also is cytotoxic to guinea pigand rabbit peritoneal macrophages. Type D causes enterotoxemia of lambs, sheep, goats, cattle, possibly humans (veryrarely), and chinchillas.Iota toxin is produced only by type E. This toxin is elaborated as a prototoxin that is usually activated by proteolyticenzymes produced by the organism. Iota toxin markedlyincreases vascular permeability, produces necrosis on intradermal injection, and is lethal on intravenous injection. Theorganism is sometimes carried by normal sheep and cattle,and is purported to be a rare cause of enterotoxemia in calves.Iota toxin has been implicated (by antitoxic neutralization)as a cause of antimicrobialinduced colitis in rabbits, thecausative organism probably is Clostridium spiroforme; iota-liketoxic activity is produced by strains tentatively identified asClostridium spiroforme.Type A strains and some type C and D strains produce anenterotoxin; Clostridium perfringens food poisoning in humansis produced by type A strains. Food poisoning can be causedby strains that produce only heat-sensitive spores, as well as bystrains that produce heat-resistant spores. Spores that survivecooking may germinate and proliferate to high counts infood products (usually warm meats or meat products); wheningested, the vegetative cells sporulate in the gut and releaseenterotoxin. Enterotoxin is a product of the sporulationprocess and causes fluid accumulation in the small intestineof laboratory animals. Feeding of purified enterotoxin tovolunteers reproduces the food poisoning syndrome. Type A enterotoxin as been implicated as the cause of a lethalenteritis in horses.Clostridium perfringens also produces a variety of other substances that have been referred to as toxins. The role of thesefactors as regards virulence and pathogenicity either is notsignificant or is not known. Other possible “virulence factors”include sialidase and a non-alpha-delta-theta hemolysin.Other characteristics of the species are given in Table 3.Some allegedly lecithinase-negative strains can be shown toproduce lecithinase on a modified medium.This species is more widely spread in nature than anyother pathogenic microorganism. Although most investigators do not type their isolates, it has been stated that onlytype A strains are found as part of the microflora of both soiland intestinal tracts, and that types B, C, D, and E seem tobe obligate parasites of animals and occasionally are foundin humans. Sources yielding Clostridium perfringens includesoil and marine sediment samples worldwide, clothing, rawmilk, cheese, semipreserved meat products, and venison.Clostridium perfringens has been isolated from the intestinalcontents of virtually every animal that has been investigated.It has also been isolated from pheasant small intestine andfrom rattlesnake venom.In addition to causing specific toxin-induced diseases,Clostridium perfringens has also been isolated from a variety ofmixed anaerobic/aerobic pyogenic infections of a numberof different species of domesticated animals.Humans frequently carry Clostridium perfringens as part ofthe normal endogenous flora. Although this species can berecovered in a small percentage of patients from the normaloral flora, the normal cervicovaginal flora, from urine (presumably reflecting the flora of the distal urethra), and fromthe skin of the antecubital fossae of approximately 20% ofsubjects, the main site of carriage is the distal gastrointestinaltract.Approximately 80% of cases of gas gangrene (clostridialmyonecrosis) involve Clostridium perfringens. In addition, thisspecies has been reported to cause bacteremia (with and without intravascular hemolysis).Clostridium perfringens is the species of Clostridium mostcommonly isolated from infections in humans; such infections are often polymicrobial. Although virtually every typeof infection in humans has yielded Clostridium perfringens onone or more occasions, it is most commonly recovered frominfections derived from the colonic flora (e.g., peritonitis,intra-abdominal abscess, and soft tissue infections below thewaist).Source: infections in humans, especially from colonic flora.DNA G+C content (mol%): 24–27 (Tm).Type strain: ATCC 13124, BCRC (formerly CCRC) 10913,CCUG 1795, CIP 103409, DSM 756, JCM 1290, LMG 11264,NCAIM B.01417, NCCB 89165, NCIMB 6125, NCTC 8237.Reference strains: type B: ATCC 3626, NCIB 10691; type C:ATCC, 3628, NCIB 10662; type D: ATCC 3629, NCIB 10663;type E: ATCC 27324, NCIB 10748.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA gene): M59103.Further comments: 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisonsshow Clostridium perfringens to fall within the radiationof the cluster I of the clostridia as defined by Collinset al.

Isolates previously identified as“Clostridium plagarum” possess a high degree of DNA homology (Nakamura et al., 1976) and 100% rRNA homologywith Clostridium perfringens; such isolates should be considered lecithinase-negative, theta “toxin” negative variants ofClostridium perfringens (Nakamura et al., 1976).

DMBP00002260	 Description of Campylobacter cuniculorum sp. nov.Campylobacter cuniculorum (cu.ni.cu.lo′rum. L. gen. pl. n. cuniculorum of rabbits).Cells are spiral, Gram-negative rods, motile, 0.2–0.4 μm wide and 1.9–3.3 μm long, possessing a single flagellum at both poles. After subculturing on nutrient sheep-blood agar, colonies are grey–green, flat with rough margins and slightly mucoid-looking; after 72–96 h at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions, colonies are smooth, α-Haemolytic, 1–2 mm in diameter. Colony appearance on modified-charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA) and cefoperazone, amphotericin B, teicoplanin selective supplement (CAT) is similar to that on nutrient agar but growth on the first medium is slightly restricted. Strictly microaerobic. Able to grow at 37 °C and most strains grow at 42 °C; no growth at 25 °C or under anaerobic or aerobic conditions. Hydrogen is not required for growth. Oxidase and catalase are produced, but not urease, γ-glutamyltranspeptidase or alkaline phosphatase. Hydrolyses indoxyl acetate but not hippurate, and reduces nitrate but not selenite. Some strains reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and grow on nutrient agar without blood but not on MacConkey agar. No growth occurs in the presence of 1 % (w/v) glycine and 2 % (w/v) NaCl and only few strains grow in the presence of 1 % (w/v) bile. Most strains are resistant to (μg per disc) nalidixic acid (30) and cephalothin (30) by disc diffusion test. Strains have been recovered from rabbit caecal contents but pathogenicity is unknown. The G+C content of the type strain is 32.4 mol%.The type strain is 150BT (=LMG 24588T =CCUG 56289T), which was isolated from a rabbit in 2005.DOI:10.1099/ijs.0.007286-0
DMBP00002269	 Campylobacter hepaticus [he.pa′ti.cus. N.L. masc. adj. hepaticus (from Gr. adj. hepatikos) of the liver, from which the bacterium was first isolated].Cells are Gram-stain-negative, S-shaped, 0.3–0.4 µm wide and 1.0–1.2 µm long after 3 days of incubation on HBA in a microaerophilic atmosphere at 37 °C. Colonies are wet and cream-coloured; some are convex while others are flat and spreading. They vary in size and morphology after long incubation times. Cells are coccoid after 12 days of incubation. Non-Haemolytic. Cells are motile and possess a single flagellum at both poles. They are catalase- and oxidase-positive and urease-negative. Strains may differ in their ability to reduce nitrate or hydrolyse hippurate. The type strain hydrolyses hippurate but does not reduce nitrate. Hydrogen sulphide is not produced in triple-sugar iron medium. All strains hydrolyse indoxyl acetate. No growth under aerobic conditions at 37 °C, under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C or under microaerobic conditions at 25 °C. All are able to grow at 37 and 42 °C microaerobically. Does not require hydrogen to grow. All strains can grow on nutrient agar without blood, but most of them cannot grow on MacConkey agar. Strains grow on blood agar medium supplemented with 1 % glycine, 1 % bile and metronidazole (4 mg l−1) and grow weakly on 0.04 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. All strains are resistant or show intermediate resistance to nalidixic acid (30 µg per disc) and most of them are resistant to cephalothin (30 µg per disc) by disc diffusion tests. This novel species has been isolated from birds with SLD and is likely to be pathogenic to chickens, but pathogenicity to humans is unknown.The type strain, HV10T (=NCTC 13823T=CIP 111092T), was isolated from the liver of a chicken with SLD in 2015. The DNA G+C content of the type strain is 27.9 mol%.

DMBP00002275	Campylobacter jejuni(Jones, Orcutt and Little 1931) Véron and Chatelain1973, 128AL (Vibrio jejuni Jones, Orcutt and Little 1931,861; Vibrio hepaticus Mathey and Rissberger 1964 1339;Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni Smibert 1974, 209.)...................................................................................je.ju’ni. M.L. gen. neut. n. jejuni of the jejunum.Small, tightly coiled spiral or S-shaped cells (averagewavelength 1.12 μm and average amplitude of coils is 0.48μm) which transform rapidly to coccoid forms with age, orexposure to toxic concentrations of oxygen (Ng et al., 1985;Moran and Upton, 1987). Electron microscopic studies reveala ring-shaped cellular form that may represent an intermediate form between spiral and coccoid cells (Ng et al., 1985).Two types of colonies may be observed (Smibert, 1965, 1969).The first has a low, flat, grayish, finely granular, and translucent appearance with an irregular edge, and a tendency tospread along the direction of the streak, and to swarm andcoalesce. The second is round (1–2 mm diameter), raised,convex, smooth, shiny, with an entire, translucent edge and adarker, opaque center. Most strains are weakly hemolytic onblood agar (Arimi et al., 1990; On et al., 1996), but this characteristic may be affected by composition and pH of the basemedium used, the gas composition of the atmosphere, andthe period and temperature of incubation (Arimi et al. 1990;Misawa et al., 1995). Hemolytic activity has been reportedfor rabbit, human, cattle, sheep, goat, horse, and chickenblood (Misawa et al., 1995) and appears to be principallycell associated, although a secreted component may also beinvolved (see Wassenaar, 1997 for a detailed overview). Allstrains will grow in the presence of 1.0% ox-bile. No growthis observed at 25∘C. Strains are motile by means of a singlepolar flagellum (at one or both ends of the cell) which seemsto be an important virulence factor, necessary for colonization of the intestinal tract (Ketley, 1997). In addition, phaseand antigenic variation of the flagellar protein may serve asa means of evading the immunogenic response of the host.Variation of the flagellin gene loci (flaA and flaB) may bedetected by PCR-based methods and used in molecular epidemiological studies (Nachamkin et al., 1993; Ayling et al.,1996; Meinersmann et al., 1997). Recombination may affectthe stability of the flaA-based methods and possibly acts as amechanism by which the immunogenic repertoire of a givenstrain is increased (Harrington et al., 1997).The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 28–33 (Tm).Type strain: CIP 702, ATCC 33560, CCUG 11284, LMG8841, NCTC 11351.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA): L04315, M59298.10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01071
DMBP00002301	AbstractA novel, alkaliphilic, psychrotolerant, facultative anaerobe, designated CP1T, was isolated from sandy soil near the Davis Station in Antarctica. The short-rod-shaped cells displayed Gram-positive staining and did not form spores. Strain CP1T was able to grow at temperatures between 4 and 36 °C, pH 6.0-9.5, and in the presence of up to 5.0 % (w/v) NaCl. 16S rRNA gene and multilocus (pheS, rpoA, and atpA) sequence analysis revealed Carnobacterium mobile DSM 4848T and Carnobacterium iners LMG 26642T as the closest relatives (97.4 and 97.1 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively). The genomic G+C content was 38.1 mol%, and DNA-DNA hybridization with DSM 4848T revealed 32.4±3.4 % similarity. The major fatty acid components were C14 : 0 and C16 : 1ω9c. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and was of peptidoglycan type A1γ. Based on physiological, genotypic and biochemical characteristics, strain CP1T represents a novel species of the genus Carnobacterium for which the name Carnobacterium antarcticum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CP1T (=DSM 103363T=CGMCC 1.15643T).10.1099/ijsem.0.002727

This strain isnonmotile, although it was originally described as motile bymeans of peritrichous flagella. This discrepancy casts a doubton the whole original description; it is also possible that theavailable strain is not one of the original ones. Hence, thefeatures presented in Table 1 were taken from Holmes et al.(1984a), Holmes (1992), Hugo et al. (2003), and Bernardetet al. (2005).

After growthfor 2 days at 30∘C on trypticase soy agar, colonies are circular and yellow pigmented with a diameter of 2–3 mm.Yellow flexirubin-type pigments are produced. Grows at25∘C but not at 4 or 37∘C. Grows on plain nutrient agarand on nutrient agar containing up to 2 % NaCl, but noton nutrient agar containing 3 % NaCl. No growth on Simmons’ citrate agar. Positive for gelatinase and hemolyticactivities, hydrolysis of Tween 20, oxidation of gluconate,and fluorescence on King B agar. Acetoin, lecithinase, arginine dihydrolase, lysine, and ornithine decarboxylases andtryptophan deaminase are produced. The major fatty acidsare iso-C15 : 0, iso-C17 : 1 cis9, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH, and iso-C15 : 02-OH.

On the basis of 16S rRNAgene sequencing, this species is most closely related to C.oncorhynchi (99%), followed by C. lactis (98.9%) and C. nakagawai (98.6%). Despite the near-identity of 16S sequenceidentity between C. oncorhynchi and C. ureilyticum, the typestrain of C. oncorhynchi was reported to have a DNA–DNAhybridization of 53% when compared to the type strain ofC. ureilyticum—well below the 70% cut-off to be considered aseparate species.Source: The type strain was isolated from a steel surface ofa beer-bottling plant in Germany.DNA G+C content (mol%): 36.4 (HPLC).Type strain: F-Fue-04IIIaaaa (DSM 18017, CCUG 52546).Reference strains: The “123 group,” consisting of strainsG0186 and G0240, was ascribed to C. ureilyticum based on16S rRNA sequence by Holmes et al. (2013). However, theanalysis of whole-genome sequences of G0186 finds that itbelongs to a novel species (G0240 data is pending). Since thetype strain of C. oncorhynchi has not yet been sequenced, itremains possible that the “123 group” actually represents thestrains of C. oncorhynchi (A.

DMBP00002577	Clostridium septicum*(Macé 1889) Ford 1927, 726AL (Bacillus septicus Macé1889, 445)...................................................................................sep’ti.cum. L. neut. adj. septicum putrefactive.Cells in PYG broth culture are Gram-stain-positive inyoung cultures but may be Gram-stain-negative in oldercultures; staining is often uneven, resulting in intenselyGram-stain-positive bars or spots interspersed with decolorized areas. Cells in broth are straight or curved rods thatoccur singly or in pairs, are usually motile and peritrichous,and are 0.6–1.9 × 1.9–35.0 μm. Forms long filaments onthe peritoneal surface of the liver of infected animals incontrast to other pathogenic species of Clostridium. Cellsmay be extremely pleomorphic under certain conditions.Spores are oval, subterminal, and distend the cell. There isno exosporium and the spore lacks appendages.Cell wall contains L-lysine in place of DAP. Glutamic acidand alanine are present; cell-wall sugars are glucose, galactose, rhamnose, and mannose. The cell wall is susceptible todissolution by lysozyme.Colonies on the surface of blood agar are 1–5 mm indiameter, circular, with markedly irregular to rhizoid margins, slightly raised, translucent, gray, glossy, and β-hemolytic.Surface growth of most strains on 1.5% agar is an invisiblefilm over the entire agar surface; this swarming often maybe prevented by shortening the incubation period or using4–6% agar in the medium. Subsurface colonies in 1% agarare spherical or lenticular and transparent; in 2% agar,colonies are brownish-yellow and heart shaped.Cultures in PYG broth are turbid with a smooth sedimentand have a pH of 4.7–5.3 after incubation for 5 d.The temperature range for optimum growth is 37–40 ∘C;most strains grow well at 44 ∘C but not at all at 46 ∘C. CO2is not required for growth, but good growth occurs in atmospheres containing up to 100% CO2. Growth is stimulatedby the presence of a fermentable carbohydrate, serum, orpeptic digest of blood. In chopped-meat medium, the meatparticles commonly turn pink after 48 h incubation. Factorsessential for growth include biotin, nicotinic acid, pyridoxine, thiamin, cysteine, tryptophan, iron and, for some strains,pantothenate. Adenine, arginine, aspartic acid, histidine,isoleucine, phenylalanine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, andvaline are also required. Exposure of exponential-phasecultures of this species to hyperbaric oxygen (100% O2 at3 atm) is relatively nonlethal compared with other species;approximately 50% of cells of Clostridium septicum survivethis treatment. Abundant gas is produced in PYG deep agarcultures.Adonitol, dulcitol, erythritol, and glycerol are not fermented; sorbose occasionally is fermented weakly. Neutralred and resazurin are reduced and ammonia is produced bysome strains; hippurate is hydrolyzed by 3 of 17 strains tested.Phage-like particles produced by a strain of Clostridiumsepticum inhibit the growth of a strain of Clostridium sporogenes. This strain of Clostridium septicum is in turn inhibitedby strains of Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium butyricum,Clostridium cadaveris, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tertium, and Clostridium tetani. All of 16 strains of Clostridium septicum tested were susceptible to bacteriocins produced by9 of 21 strains of Streptococcus faecium or Streptococcus faecalisstudied. Bacteriocin produced by Clostridium septicum inhibited RNA and protein synthesis, and rapidly kills all 16 strainsof Clostridium septicum and all 10 strains of Clostridium chauvoeitested, but none of a variety of other species of bacteria.One strain of Clostridium septicum has been shown tohydrolyze the conjugated bile acids taurocholate and glycocholate. All of 26 strains tested produce deoxyribonuclease(beta toxin) and hyaluronidase (gamma toxin) in both acidicand alkaline conditions. An oxygen-stable hemolysin withnecrotizing properties (alpha toxin), and an oxygen-labilehemolysin (delta toxin) are also produced. A neuraminidaseand a hemagglutinin are produced. Chitinase is produced.Uracil is not utilized. Although lipase is not detected onegg-yolk agar plates, traces of lipidolytic activity, detected bya gas-liquid chromatographic method, have been reportedin a strain of this species.Products in PYG broth include large amounts of aceticand butyric acids, and usually large amounts of formicacid. Abundant H2 is produced. Electron capture gas-liquidchromatography has detected butanol, isoamyl alcohol, andpropionic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and isocaproic as well asacetic and butyric acids in chopped-meat glucose culturesof Clostridium septicum. Lactate usually is not utilized, butincreased butyrate may be formed in PY-lactate broth. Pyruvate is converted to acetate and butyrate and, occasionally,to formate. Threonine is not converted to propionate. Oleicacid is converted to hydroxystearic acid.Ethylamine was detected in the head-space gas abovea chopped-meat glucose culture of one isolate. All strainstested are susceptible to chloramphenicol, clindamycin,erythromycin, penicillin G, and tetracycline.This species is capable of causing rapidly fatal infectionsin humans and other animals by production of its lethalhemolytic and necrotizing alpha toxin. A lethal disseminated infection can be produced in mice and guinea pigs byintramuscular injection of fewer than 10 spores plus CaCl2;postmortem examination reveals bloodstained edema fluid,a deep red color of the muscle and soft tissue, gas formationin the inoculated limb, and dissemination of the organismto all parts of the body. In cattle, wound infection produces“malignant edema”, a disease similar to the experimental disease in laboratory animals, as described above; and in sheep,braxy, a fatal bacteremic infection following penetration ofthe abomasal wall. Similar diseases have been noted in otherspecies of domestic and wild animals. Clostridium septicum,Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium novyi are the three mostcommon causes of clostridial myonecrosis (gas gangrene).Such infection may occur either by direct contaminationof an infected traumatic wound or by metastatic infectionfollowing bacteremia from the gastrointestinal tract; in thelatter case, a breech in the bowel mucosa (such as due to amalignancy) serves as the portal of entry. The mechanism ofdisease production apparently is similar to that of the animalmodel described above. Other characteristics of the speciesare given in Table 3.Source: soil; probably the gastrointestinal tract contentsof many domesticated animals; rattlesnake venom; feces ofhuman infants and adults; animal infections including woundinfections; myositis and enterotoxemia in ruminants and bacteremia; human infections including bacteremia, suppurativeinfections, necrotizing enterocolitis, and myonecrosis or gasgangrene.DNA G+C content (mol%): 24 (Tm).Type strain: ATCC 12464, CCM 5743, BCRC 14552, CCUG4855, CIP 61.10, CN 3790, DSM 7534, JCM 8144, NCCB47070, NCIB 547, NCTC 547, NRRL B-3197.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA gene): U59278.Further comments: 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showsClostridium septicum to fall within the radiation of cluster I ofthe clostridia as defined by Collins et al.

DMBP00002589	Clostridium tetani*(Flügge 1886) Bergey, Harrison, Breed, Hammer andHuntoon 1923, 330AL (Bacillus tetani Flügge 1886, 274)...................................................................................te’ta.ni. L. n. tetanus (from Gr. n. tetanos) tension, tetanus; L.gen. n. tetani of a tension, of tetanus.Cells in young cultures are Gram-stain-positive, butbecome Gram-stain-negative after approximately 24 h incubation. Most strains are motile and peritrichous. Cells are0.5–1.7 × 2.1–18.1 μm and occur singly or in pairs. Sporesare usually round and terminal; occasionally they may beoval or subterminal, or both. Spores will germinate in liverbroth at a starting O/R potential of up to +580 mV, but vegetative growth does not occur unless the culture is coveredwith liquid paraffin. When spores of Clostridium tetani wereintroduced orally or intrarectally into germ-free rats, thespores remained viable in the intestinal tract but were unableto germinate. Vegetative cells given by oral swabs did colonizethe intestinal tract and stimulated the production of antitoxin, but no toxin was detected. Cell wall contains meso-DAP;cell-wall sugars are primarily glucose and rhamnose withtraces of galactose and mannose. Cell wall is susceptible todissolution by lysozyme.Colonies on the surface of blood agar are 4–6 mm indiameter, flat, translucent, gray, with a matt surface, irregular and rhizoid margins, and usually cause a narrow zoneof β-hemolysis. There is a tendency to swarm that is moremarked on moist plates. Colonies in agar are transparent andvery woolly.Cultures in PYG broth are turbid with a smooth or ropysediment and have a pH of 6.1–6.5 after incubation for 5 d.The optimum temperature for growth is 37 ∘C; there is moderate growth at 30 ∘C, little or none at 25 ∘C or 45 ∘C. Growthis inhibited by 20% bile or 6.5% NaCl. Exposure of exponential phase cultures to hyperbaric oxygen (100% O2 at 3atm) resulted in death of more than 99.9% of cells. Moderate to abundant gas is produced by most strains in PYG deepagar cultures. Ammonia and H2S are produced, neutral redis reduced, and resazurin is usually reduced. Deoxyribonuclease is produced; neuraminidase is not produced.Products of metabolism in PYG broth are butanol, largeamounts of acetate and butyrate, and small amounts of propionate; lactate and succinate may also be produced. Abundant H2 is produced. Lactate and threonine are convertedto propionate, pyruvate is converted to butyrate and acetate.Phenol is produced by all strains and indole by some strains inbroth supplemented with L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan, andL-tyrosine. All strains utilize aspartate, glutamate, histidine,and serine for growth; some strains utilize methionine, threonine, and tyrosine. Glutamate is converted to ammonia, CO2,acetate and butyrate via a methylaspartate pathway.All of seven strains tested are susceptible to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, erythromycin, penicillin G, andtetracycline.Major lipid fatty acids formed in a trypticase-yeastextract-thioglycollate medium without glucose are normalsaturated C12, C14, C16, and C18 acids and smaller amounts ofunsaturated C18 and C16 acid with a double bond at the 7 or9 position. Branched chain fatty acids are not present.Two pathogenic soluble antigens, tetanolysin andtetanospasmin, are produced. Injection of partially purified tetanolysin produces electrocardiographic changes inmonkeys and mice and intravascular hemolysis in rabbits andmonkeys; there is little evidence, however, that tetanolysin is normally involved in disease production. Tetanospasmin,the cause of clinical tetanus in humans and other animals,is an extremely potent neurotoxin that probably spreads tothe central nervous system both by passage up perineuraltissue, and by lymphatic and hematogenous routes from alocalized site of production; the toxin suppresses centralinhibitory influences on motor neurons thereby leading toexcessive muscle activity that is manifest by spasticity andtetanic contractions. Localized forms of tetanus may alsooccur. A “nonspasmogenic toxin” has been detected (inpartially purified form) and may interfere with functionof motor nerve. A high molecular mass hemolysin that isdistinct from tetanolysin has been detected. Although bacteriophages have been recovered from some strains, theydo not appear to be involved in toxigenicity. Toxigenicity isprobably plasmid-related. Other characteristics of the speciesare given in Table 3.This is a ubiquitous organism.Source: soil throughout the world; human and otheranimal feces particularly horse feces; the atmosphere in ahospital; occasionally from wounds in animals and woundsin humans including infected gums and teeth, corneal ulcerations, mastoid and middle ear infections, intraperitonealinfection, omphalitis (tetanus neonatorum), postpartumuterine infections, various soft tissue infections relatedto trauma (including abrasions and lacerations), use ofcontaminated needles and catgut.DNA G+C content (mol%): 25–26 (Tm).Type strain: ATCC 19406, CCUG 4220, NCTC 279.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA gene): X74770.Further comments: 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisonsshow Clostridium tetani to fall within the radiation of cluster Iof the clostridia as defined by Collins et al.

DMBP00002605	4.1. Description of E. oligotrophica sp. novEnterobacter oligotrophica (o.li.go.tro'phi.ca. Gr. adj. oligos little; Gr. adj. trophikos nursing, tending or feeding; N.L. fem. adj. oligotrophica eating little, referring to a bacterium living on low‐nutrient media).Cells are aerobic, Gram‐negative, non‐sporulating, and rod‐shaped (1.0–2.0 μm × 4.0–5.0 μm). Colonies are circular, smooth, glistening, light yellow, and grow to 5.0 mm in diameter on Nutrient Broth plates after incubation for 24 hr at 37°C. Growth is observed in poor‐nutrient medium, and growth is unaffected by high‐nutrient medium. The VP test is negative. The major cellular fatty acids are C16:0 and sums of C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c or C18 : 1ω6c and/or C18 : 1ω7c. The predominant quinone system is ubiquinone‐8. Growth is observed in Nutrient Broth at 10–45°C and pH 4.5–10.0, with optimal growth at 20°C and pH 5.0. Growth occurs in the presence of 0–6% (w/v) NaCl as well as ampicillin. Strain CCA6 is positive for lysine decarboxylase. No growth occurs on d‐sucrose, d‐melibiose, d‐turanose, d‐tagatose, inositol, or methyl‐α‐d‐glucopyranoside. Strain CCA6 is clearly separated from the related Enterobacter type strains by MLSA based on partial sequences of the atpD, gyrB, infB, and rpoB gene. The genome size of the type strain is 4,476,585 bp, which has a G+C content of 54.3%. novel oligotrophic bacterium, designated strain CCA6, was isolated from leaf soil collected in Japan. Cells of the strain were found to be a Gram-negative, non-sporulating, motile, rod-shaped bacterium. Strain CCA6 grew at 10–45°C (optimum 20°C) and pH 4.5–10.0 (optimum pH 5.0). The strain was capable of growth in poor-nutrient (oligotrophic) medium, and growth was unaffected by high-nutrient medium. The major fatty acid and predominant quinone system were C16:0 and ubiquinone-8. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated strain CCA6 presented as a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on fragments of the atpD, gyrB, infB, and rpoB gene sequences was performed to further identify strain CCA6. The MLSA showed clear branching of strain CCA6 with respect to Enterobacter type strains. The complete genome of strain CCA6 consisted of 4,476,585 bp with a G+C content of 54.3% and comprising 4,372 predicted coding sequences. The genome average nucleotide identity values between strain CCA6 and the closest related Enterobacter type strain were <88.02%. Based on its phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic features, strain CCA6 (=HUT 8142T =KCTC 62525T) can be considered as a novel species within the genus Enterobacter with the proposed name Enterobacter oligotrophica.

Ralstonia named after E.Ralston, American bacteriologist who first describedPseudomonas pickettii and suggested a taxonomic relationship to P solanacearum based on DNA homologybetween them).Cells of species of this genus are Gram-negative rodshaped, motile with single polar or peritrichous flagellaor non-motile without flagella. Oxidase activity is van able by species. Monosaccharides, disaccharides andpolyalcohols are oxidized and assimilated as a solesource of carbon and energy, as reported previously(15). The absence of assimilation of galactose, mannitol,mannose, and sorbitol by the type strain of three Ralstonia species is a differential phenotypic marker to distinguish strains of Ralstonia sp. from those of Burkholderia species (Table 2). Cellular lipids of the, typestrains of three Ralstonia species contain phosphatidylethanolamine possessing 2-hydroxy fatty acid at the sn2 position of the glycerol moiety, similar to those ofBurkholderia species (19). As shown in Fig. 1, the typestrains of three Ralstonia species failed to demonstratetwo kinds of ornithine-lipids on two-dimensional thinlayer chromatography and to reveal C19 cyclopropanoicacid in cellular fatty acids (Table 4). The presence ofthese cellular lipids and fatty acid components wereclearly demonstrated in Burkholderia cepacia and theother five Burkholderia species (19).Flagellar morphology has long been one of the important features for the classification and identification ofGram-negative bacterial strains. However, it is nowknown that certain species lose their flagella when theybecome facultatively parasitic. For example, peritrichousEscherichia coli might change to atrichous Shigellaspecies or polar multitrichous Burkholderia pseudomallei to atrichous B. mallei. It is well-known that E. coli isgenetically the same species as Shigella sp., as well as B.pseudomallei and B. mallei. Cells of certain species ofmarine bacteria possess both sheathed polar monotrichous flagella and unsheathed lateral flagella whengrown on the surface of semisolid media incubated ataround 20 C, while they fail to produce lateral flagellawhen grown in liquid media at 37 C. Thus, the significance of flagellar morphology in the classification oridentification at generic or familiar levels seems to bereduced. Species with different flagellar morphology inone genus, Ralstonia gen. nov. could not be eliminatedfrom the genus.Strains of R. pickettii are isolated from various clinical specimens and hospital environments with doubtfulpathogenicity. The heterogeneity of R. solanacearumstrains (11) remained to be solved taxonomically. R.solanacearum is known to be pathogenic for Solanumlycopersicum (tomato, potato, tobacco). Also isolatedfrom Casuarina, Strelitzia, ginger, banana, Heloconia,peanut and Pelargonium (M. Gillis, personal communication).

Type speciesis Ralstonia pickettii (Ralston, Palleroni and Doudoroff1973) comb. nov.and Ralstonia solanacearum are the same as those reported previously (18).

DMBP00002661	AbstractWhen analysing a large cohort of Staphylococcus Haemolyticus, using whole-genome sequencing, five human isolates (four from the skin and one from a blood culture) with aberrant phenotypic and genotypic traits were identified. They were phenotypically similar with yellow colonies, nearly identical 16S rRNA gene sequences and initially speciated as S. Haemolyticus based on 16S rRNA gene sequence and MALDI-TOF MS. However, compared to S. Haemolyticus, these five strains demonstrate: (i) considerable phylogenetic distance with an average nucleotide identity <95 % and inferred DNA-DNA hybridization <70 %; (ii) a pigmented phenotype; (iii) urease production; and (iv) different fatty acid composition. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic results, we conclude that these strains represent a novel species, for which the name Staphylococcus borealis sp. nov. is proposed. The novel species belong to the genus Staphylococcus and is coagulase- and oxidase-negative and catalase-positive. The type strain, 51-48T, is deposited in the Culture Collection University of Gothenburg (CCUG 73747T) and in the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT 30011T).Keywords: Coagulase-negative staphylococci; Staphylococcus; Staphylococcus borealis; Staphylococcus Haemolyticus; urease; whole-genome sequencing. Staphylococcus borealis (bo.re.a′lis. L. masc. adj. borealis related to the North, boreal).Colonies are 3–5 mm in diameter, round, smooth and have a yellow tint. The difference in pigmentation between typical S. Haemolyticus and S. borealis colonies is particularly evident on different supplemented P-agars (non-supplemented, full fat milk and horse blood) after 48 h at 37 °C. Cells are Gram-stain-positive, coccoid, 650 nm to 1.23 µm in diameter and form clusters. They are facultative anaerobic, coagulase-negative and catalase-positive. They are biochemically negative for fructose and mannitol and positive for production of urease. The major fatty acids are branched fatty acid pairs C15 : 0 iso, C15 : 0 anteiso and C17 : 0 anteiso and C17 : 0 iso, while the straight-chain fatty acid C18 : 0 is present in a much lower amount.

DMBP00002685	AbstractStrains isolated independently from two patients could be recognized as Ralstonia pickettii biovar 3/'thomasii'. The 16S rDNA sequences of these strains and two other strains of R. pickettii biovar 3/'thomasii' clustered at less than 98% similarity versus all other described Ralstonia species and at less than 97 % versus the two other R. pickettii biovars. The separate species status of R. pickettii biovar 3/'thomasii' was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization, indicating less than 60% DNA homology with the R. pickettii biovars Va-1 and Va-2 and with two as-yet unclassified but biochemically similar Ralstonia strains. Phenotypically, this Ralstonia species can be distinguished from all described Ralstonia species by its acidification of D-arabitol and mannitol and by its lack of nitrate reduction and of alkalinization of tartrate and from two as-yet unclassified Ralstonia strains only by its lack of nitrate reduction. The name Ralstonia mannitolytica sp. nov. is proposed, reflecting the characteristic acidification of mannitol. Resistance to desferrioxamine is another difference from R. pickettii and Ralstonia solanacearum. Although several nosocomial outbreaks have been associated with R. mannitolytica, life-threatening infections have not yet been reported, possibly due to misidentification as Pseudomonas fluorescens or Burkholderia cepacia. In at least one of the two cases reported here, the R. mannitolytica isolate was found to be clinically relevant, causing recurrent nosocomial meningitis, with an infected implanted catheter as the source. The type strain of R. mannitolytica is NCIMB 10805T (= LMG 6866T), which was isolated during the first described outbreak as 'Pseudomonas thomasii' at St Thomas' Hospital, London, UK, in 1971.10.1099/00207713-51-2-547Ralstonia mannitolilyticaDe Baere, Steyaert, Wauters, De Vos, Goris, Coenye,Suyama, Verschraegen and Vaneechoutte 2001, 556VP...................................................................................man.ni.to.li.ly’ti.ca.

DMBP00002689	AbstractTo clarify the evolutionary relationships and classification of Bacillus species, comprehensive phylogenomic and comparative analyses were performed on >300 Bacillus/Bacillaceae genomes. Multiple genomic-scale phylogenetic trees were initially reconstructed to identify different monophyletic clades of Bacillus species. In parallel, detailed analyses were performed on protein sequences of genomes to identify conserved signature indels (CSIs) that are specific for each of the identified clades. We show that in different reconstructed trees, most of the Bacillus species, in addition to the Subtilis and Cereus clades, consistently formed 17 novel distinct clades. Additionally, some Bacillus species reliably grouped with the genera Alkalicoccus, Caldalkalibacillus, Caldibacillus, Salibacterium and Salisediminibacterium. The distinctness of identified Bacillus species clades is independently strongly supported by 128 identified CSIs which are unique characteristics of these clades, providing reliable means for their demarcation. Based on the strong phylogenetic and molecular evidence, we are proposing that these 17 Bacillus species clades should be recognized as novel genera, with the names Alteribacter gen. nov., Ectobacillus gen. nov., Evansella gen. nov., Ferdinandcohnia gen. nov., Gottfriedia gen. nov., Heyndrickxia gen. nov., Lederbergia gen. nov., Litchfieldia gen. nov., Margalitia gen. nov., Niallia gen. nov., Priestia gen. nov., Robertmurraya gen. nov., Rossellomorea gen. nov., Schinkia gen. nov., Siminovitchia gen. nov., Sutcliffiella gen. nov. and Weizmannia gen. nov. We also propose to transfer 'Bacillus kyonggiensis' to Robertmurraya kyonggiensis sp. nov. (type strain: NB22=JCM 17569T=DSM 26768). Additionally, we report 31 CSIs that are unique characteristics of either the members of the Subtilis clade (containing the type species B. subtilis) or the Cereus clade (containing B. anthracis and B. cereus). As most Bacillus species which are not part of these two clades can now be assigned to other genera, we are proposing an emended description of the genus Bacillus to restrict it to only the members of the Subtilis and Cereus clades.Keywords: classification of Bacillus species; conserved signature indels; emendation of genus Bacillus; genus Bacillus and the family Bacillaceae; novel Bacillaceae genera Alteribacter, Ectobacillus, Evansella, Ferdinandcohnia, Gottfriedia, Heyndrickxia, Lederbergia, Litchfieldia, Margalitia, Niallia, Priestia, Robertmurraya, Rossellomorea, Schinkia, Siminovitchia, Sutcliffiella and Weizmannia; phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses.Robertmurraya (Ro.bert.mur'ray.a.

DMBP00002711	AbstractA Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped bacterium, strain S4(T), was isolated from coastal sediment collected off Xiamen, China. The physiological and biochemical features of strain S4(T), determined using the API 20NE, API ZYM and Biolog GN2 systems, were similar to those of members of the genus Shewanella. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences placed strain S4(T) in the genus Shewanella, and it was most closely related to Shewanella oneidensis and related species. DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrated only 11.9-30.4 % relatedness between S4(T) and the type strains of related Shewanella species. On the basis of phylogenetic and phenotypic characteristics, strain S4(T) is classified in the genus Shewanella as a representative of a distinct novel species, for which the name Shewanella xiamenensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is S4(T) (=CCTCC M 209017(T) =JCM 16212(T)).10.1099/ijs.0.013300-0

Gr. n. dysenteria dysentery; M.L. gen. n. dysenteriae of dysentery.Colonies of serotype 1 often have a pinkish tinge on Leifson’s deoxycholate citrate agar. Catalase is not produced by serotype 1, but is usually produced by strains of other serotypes. D-mannitol is not fermented. Dulcitol is fermented by strains of serotype 5. Gas from the fermentation of sugars is not produced. Indole is not produced by serotype 1, but is always produced by strains of serotype 2; strains of other serotypes vary in indole production. All the serotypes have, at one time or another, been known by other designations, and these are shown in Table 3. Members are intestinal pathogens of humans and subhuman primates, causing bacillary dysentery. Humans are the primary reservoir. A long-term carrier state occurs in a small percentage of cases (Levine et al., 1973). Serotype 1 causes more severe disease than other serotypes and produces a potent protein exotoxin (Shiga toxin), which plays a role in the severity of the  disease attributable to this serotype and in the development of hemolytic uremic syndrome in some individuals. Large epidemics in developing countries are commonly caused by serotype 1. Disease caused by other serotypes may be mild or severe.The mol% G + C of the DNA is: 53 (chemical analysis; Laskin and Lechevalier (1981)).Type strain: ATCC 13313, CIP 57.28, NCTC 4837.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA): X96966.Additional Remarks: Neotype strain ATCC 13313 was designated by Judicial Commission, 1963.10.1002/9781118960608.gbm01168

DMBP00002726	AbstractTwo strains, H8/1T and H16/1AT, of Gram-stain-positive, coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from separate healthy domestic dogs in Scotland. Both strains were genome sequenced and their inferred DNA-DNA hybridisation indicates that H8/1T and H16/1AT represent two novel species of the genus Staphylococcus. On the basis of the results of genome sequence analysis (genome blast distance phylogeny and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis) H8/1T is most closely related to Staphylococcus devriesei and H16/1AT most closely related to Staphylococcus felis. Also, average nucleotide identity distinguished H8/1T and H16/1AT from S. devriesei and S. felis as did minor phenotypic differences. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that H8/1T and H16/1AT represent novel species with the respective names Staphylococcus caledonicus and Staphylococcus canis. The type strain of S. caledonicus is H8/1T (=NCTC 14452T=CCUG 74789T). The type strain of S. canis is H16/1AT (=NCTC 14451T=CCUG 74790T).Keywords: Staphylococcus; novel taxa; veterinary microbiology.10.1099/ijsem.0.004878

DMBP00002754	AbstractA rod-shaped, non-endospore-forming and non-motile bacterium, strain DL-329T, was isolated from the above-ground part of a plant, Androsace koso-poljanskii Ovcz. (Primulaceae), at the the State Natural Reserve 'Belogorie', Russia. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons, the strain clustered with members of the genus Rathayibacter, showing the highest sequence similarity to Rathayibacter tritici (98.89 %), Rathayibacter rathayi (98.82 %) and Rathayibacter festucae (98.82 %). The DNA hybridization experiments demonstrated that strain DL-329T represents a separate genomic species. The results of comparative studies of physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, including cell-wall sugar patterns, polar lipid profiles, and the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectra of bacterial cells, allowed clear differentiation of VKM Ac-2121T from the recognized Rathayibacter species at the phenotypic level. Based on the data obtained, a new species, Rathayibacter oskolensis sp. nov., is proposed, with DL-329T (=VKM Ac-2121T=LMG 22542T) as the type strain.Keywords: Rathayibacter oskolensis; calciphyte plant; new species; taxonomy.10.1099/ijsem.0.002681

DMBP00002769	AbstractA Gram-stain-positive, strictly aerobic, mesophilic bacterium, designated H004T, was isolated from a water sample of the hypersaline and heliothermal Lake Ursu, Sovata, Romania. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain H004T formed a distinct phyletic lineage within the genus Rhodococcus. It shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Rhodococcus yunnanensis YIM 70056T (98.80 %), followed by Rhodococcus fascians LMG 3623T (98.73 %), Rhodococcus cercidiphylli YIM 65003T (98.73 %), Rhodococcus cerastii C5T (98.58 %) and Rhodococcus kyotonensis DS472T (98.53 %). The alkB-based phylogenetic analysis further confirmed that this strain constitutes a highly unique lineage within the genus. Chemotaxonomic characteristics, including the predominant fatty acids acids C15 : 0, C18 : 1ω9c, C19 : 1ω11c/C19 : 1ω9c and C16 : 1ω7c/iso-C15 : 0 2-OH, the major quinone MK-8(H2), the presence of mycolic acids and cell-wall chemotype IV were also consistent with the properties of members of the genus Rhodococcus. The DNA G+C content of strain H004T was 65.4 mol%. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization analyses with the closest relatives, in combination with the alkB-based phylogenetic analysis, as well as the chemotaxonomic and physiological data, demonstrated that isolate H004T represents a novel species of the genus Rhodococcus, for which the name Rhodococcus sovatensissp. nov. is proposed.

DMBP00002772	AbstractFive isolates of a previously undescribed species of purple non-sulfur phototrophic bacteria were characterized. They were Gram-negative, had mobile, budding vibrioid cells and contained lamellar intracytoplasmic membranes. Cultures produced red pigments in the light. Live cells of photosynthetic cultures exhibited absorption maxima at 382, 460-464, 494-496, 534-538, 596, 804-806 and 870-874 nm, indicating the presence of bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids belonging to the spirilloxanthin series in cells. The new isolates grew anaerobically or microaerobically in the light, but not aerobically in the dark. Optimal growth occurred at 35-40 degrees C and at pH 6.5-8.5. Various organic compounds were used as photosynthetic electron donors and carbon sources. Sulfate was used as sulfur source for growth. Ubiquinone 10 was synthesized as the major quinone. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain gc(T), a representative of the new isolates, was closest to Rhodopseudomonas palustris, with a similarity of 97.5%. DNA-DNA hybridization further distinguished strain gc(T) from Rhodopseudomonas palustris at the species level. Therefore, the name Rhodopseudomonas faecalis sp. nov. was proposed for the new isolates. The type strain is gc(T) ( = AS1.2176(T) = JCM 11668(T)).10.1099/00207713-52-6-2055

L. fem. adj. palustris marshy, swampy.Individual cells are rod-shaped to ovoid, occasionallyslightly curved, 0.6–0.9 × 1.2–2.0 μm, motile by means ofsubpolar flagella, and reproduce by budding. The mothercell produces a slender prostheca 1.5–2.0 times the lengthof the original cell at the pole opposite to that bearing theflagella. The end of the prostheca swells, and the daughter cell grows, producing a dumbbell-shaped organism(Figure 2). Asymmetric division then takes place. Youngindividual cells are highly motile. The formation of rosettesand clusters in which the individual cells are attached toeach other at their flagellated poles are characteristic inolder cultures. In certain complex media, individual cellsbecome up to 10 μm long and irregular in shape. Internalphotosynthetic membranes appear as lamellae underlyingand parallel to the cytoplasmic membrane; no lamellaeare present in the prostheca. Color of cell suspensions isred to brownish-red. Living cells show absorption maxima at 375, 468, 493, 520–545, 589, 802, and 860–875 nm.Photosynthetic pigments are bacteriochlorophyll a (esterifiedwith phytol) and carotenoids of the normal spirilloxanthinseries.Photoautotrophic growth occurs with hydrogen, sulfide,and thiosulfate as electron donors in the presence of smallamounts of yeast extract. Photoheterotrophic growth is possible with various organic substrates. Chemotrophic growthoccurs in the dark under microoxic to oxic conditions. Withsome substrates fermentation takes place under anoxic conditions. Sulfate can be used as sole sulfur source. The nitrogensource may be ammonia, dinitrogen, some amino acids, orfor a few strains, nitrate.Growth factors required are p-aminobenzoate and,for some strains, biotin; yeast extract stimulates growthconsiderably.Ubiquinones with 10 isoprene units (Q-10) are present.Mesophilic freshwater bacteria with optimal growth at30–37∘C and pH 6.9 (pH range: 5.5–8.5).The mol% G+C of the DNA is: 64.8–66.3 (Bd).Type strain: ATH 2.1.6, ATCC 17001, DSM 123.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA): D12700, D25312,L11664.10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00806

L. n. dens, dentis tooth; L. adj. cariosus -a -um decayed or decaying; N.L. fem. adj. dentocariosa tooth-decaying.Produces off white/cream colonies of 2–6 mm in diameter after 4–7 d. Cells (usually 1.0 μm in diameter) are nonmotile, Gram-stain-positive, coccoid, diphtheroid, filamentous, or mycelial. In addition, isolates form charcoal-black pigmented colonies (Daneshvar et al., 2004).Aerobic to microaerophilic. No or very poor growth anaerobically. CO2 is not required for growth. Possesses a fermentative metabolism. Optimum growth at 35–37∘C. Catalase variable. Produces acetic and lactic acid, trace amounts of pyruvic and succinic acids, but no butyric, caproic, isovaleric, or propionic acid from glucose fermentation. Reduces nitrate and nitrite. The results of indole production are contradictory. The Voges–Proskauer reaction is positive. Produces acid from fructose, glucose, maltose, salicin, sucrose, and trehalose but not adonitol, amygdalin,cellobiose, dulcitol, erythritol, glycogen, inositol, inulin, mannitol, α-methyl-D-mannoside, melibiose, raffinose, sorbitol, starch, or xylose.

No hemolysis on human and sheep blood, but variable hemolysis on rabbit blood. Grows in 2% (w/v) sodium chloride, 5% and 10% (w/v) bile, 0.01% (w/v) potassium tellurite, 0.005% (w/v) sodium azide, 0.01% (w/v) sodium selenite, and 0.2% (w/v) sodium taurocholate but not 6% (w/v) sodium chloride and 0.05% (w/v) crystal violet (Holmberg and Hallander, 1973; Kilian, 1978; Miksza-Zylkiewicz, 1980; Schofield and Schaal, 1981; Slack and Gerenscer, 1975).Characterized by the presence of iso- even-numbered fatty acids and only anteiso- odd-numbered fatty acids. Specifically, C15:0 anteiso, C16; C16:0, and C17:0 anteiso fatty acids are present with only trace amounts of other fatty acids. The peptidoglycan is of the A3α type with D-alanine and L-lysine in position 4 and 3, respectively and L-alanine in the interpeptide bridge (Von Graevenitz, 2004). The polar lipids are mono- and di-phosphatidylglycerol and the major isoprenoid quinone is MK-7. The cell wall contains fructose, galactose, glucose, and ribose (Embley et al., 1984; Hammond, 1970a; Von Graevenitz, 1999).Heterogeneity has been recognized within the species on the basis of phenotype and serotyping (Lesher et al., 1974), pyrolysis mass spectrometry (Sutcliffe et al., 1997), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Kronvall et al., 1998), with the resulting delineation of two phenotypically indistinguishable genomovars that do not correspond to biotypes (Kronvall et al., 1998); the second of these genomovars was elevated to a new species, Rothia aeria.Using antiserum to killed whole cells of Rothia for serotyping by immunofluorescence, Rothia was separated into at least three serovars. However, some isolates failed to react with any of the available antisera (Lesher et al., 1974). This suggests the existence of additional serovars.Hammond (1970a) isolated a soluble polysaccharide antigen from the cell wall with a major antigenic determinant containing fructose, glucose, galactose, and ribose. This antigen was found in all strains of Rothia tested, and may account for the cross-reactions seen between serovars.The G+C content of the DNA reported by Hammond (1970b) was questioned by Gustafson et al. (1985), who determined the value for the type strain ATCC 17931 as 53.7–54.7 ±0.43 mol%, with a slightly different result for ATCC 19426. The compromise suggested by Gustafson et al. (1985) was a value for the species of 54–57 mol%.

DMBP00002850	AbstractA novel red-pigmented, Gram-negative, motile, fluorescent, rod-shaped strain, DZ0503SBS1(T), with a single lateral flagellum, was isolated from the intestine of the nematode Heterorhabditidoides chongmingensis. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the strain is a member of the genus Serratia, sharing highest sequence similarities with Serratia marcescens subsp. sakuensis JCM 11315(T) (99.8 %), S. marcescens subsp. marcescens DSM 30121(T) (99.5 %) and Serratia ureilytica LMG 22860(T) (98.3 %). Similarities between the rpoB gene sequence of strain DZ0503SBS1(T) and those of S. marcescens subsp. sakuensis JCM 11315(T), S. marcescens subsp. marcescens DSM 30121(T) and S. ureilytica LMG 22860(T) were 98.0, 97.4 and 98.3 %, respectively. DNA-DNA hybridization values of strain DZ0503SBS1(T) with S. marcescens subsp. sakuensis JCM 11315(T), S. marcescens subsp. marcescens DSM 30121(T) and S. ureilytica LMG 22860(T) were 68.2, 65.1 and 53.0 %, respectively. The major isoprenoid quinone of strain DZ0503SBS1(T) was Q-8 and the predominant fatty acids were C(16 : 0) (34.76 %), cyclo-C(17 : 0) (20.03 %) and cyclo-C(19 : 0)omega8c (17.24 %). The cyclo-C(19 : 0)omega8c content (17.24 %) was significantly different from those found in S. marcescens subsp. sakuensis JCM 11315(T) and S. marcescens subsp. marcescens DSM 30121(T). Some characteristics of strain DZ0503SBS1(T), i.e. fluorescence and its symbiotic association with nematodes, have not been reported previously in any species of the genus Serratia. Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics and molecular data show that strain DZ0503SBS1(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Serratia nematodiphila sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is DZ0503SBS1(T) (=KCTC 22130(T) =CGMCC 1.6853(T)).10.1099/ijs.0.65718-0
DMBP00002856	AbstractEleven strains of Serratia were isolated from different soils and the guts of invertebrates and characterized by their sensitivity to eight indigenous bacteriophages. They were also classified according to bacteriocin production and sensitivity, BiOLOG plate and API 20E strip profiles and 16S rRNA sequence information. One strain was thus identified as Serratia plymuthica, another as Serratia fonticola. The remaining strains were shown to be closely related to Serratia proteamaculans subsp. quinovora Grimont et al. 1983 after DNA-DNA cross-hybridization demonstrated relatedness greater than 70% with the type strain of this subspecies. From an ecological perspective, our results illustrated the wide variation in sensitivity that closely related Serratia strains have towards various indigenous soil phages and that these phages have broad host ranges within the genus. Furthermore, the phage and bacteriocin interactions within the Serratia strains examined were intricate and did not reflect phylogenetic relationships. These results together imply that complex interactions will occur in soil within the natural community of Serratia strains and their bacteriophages. DNA-DNA cross-hybridization and phenotypic characterization showed that S. proteamaculans subsp. quinovora strains formed a cohesive group at the species level. It is therefore concluded that these strains should be designated as Serratia quinivorans corrig., sp. nov.10.1099/00207713-52-6-2281

DMBP00002864	AbstractA Gram-stain positive, long, rod-shaped, motile, and spore-forming bacterium (MEB199T) was isolated from a sediment sample collected from Lonar Lake, India. The strain was oxidase and catalase positive. The strain grew optimally at pH 10, NaCl concentration of 3.5% at 37°C. The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, anteiso-C15:0, and iso-C17:0. The peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP). Phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylglycerol were the major polar lipids of MEB199T. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain MEB199T belonged to the family Bacillaceae and exhibited a distinctive position among the members of the genus Alkalihalobacillus (Ahb.). Strain MEB199T shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Alkalihalobacillus alkalinitrilicus ANL-iso4T (98.36%), whereas with type species Ahb. alcalophilus DSM 485T, it is 94.91%, indicating that strain MEB199T is distinctly related to the genus Alkalihalobacillus. The G + C content of genomic DNA was 36.47 mol%. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) (23.6%) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) (81%) values between strain MEB199T and Ahb. alkalinitrilicus ANL-iso4T confirmed the novelty of this new species. The pairwise identity based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence between the species of genus Alkalihalobacillus ranges from 87.4 to 99.81% indicating the heterogeneity in the genus. The different phylogenetic analysis based on the genome showed that the members of the genus Alkalihalobacillus separated into eight distinct clades. The intra-clade average amino acid identity (AAI) and percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) range from 52 to 68% and 37 to 59%, respectively, which are interspersed on the intra-genera cutoff values; therefore, we reassess the taxonomy of genus Alkalihalobacillus. The phenotypic analysis also corroborated the differentiation between these clades. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, genomic indices, and phenotypic traits, we propose the reclassification of the genus Alkalihalobacillus into seven new genera for which the names Alkalihalobacterium gen. nov., Halalkalibacterium gen. nov., Halalkalibacter gen. nov., Shouchella gen. nov., Pseudalkalibacillus gen. nov., Alkalicoccobacillus gen. nov., and Alkalihalophilus gen. nov. are proposed and provide an emended description of Alkalihalobacillus sensu stricto. Also, we propose the Ahb. okuhidensis as a heterotypic synonym of Alkalihalobacillus halodurans.

DMBP00002865	The description is taken from the current study for strains of DNA hybridization group 11. Colonies are yellow and circular with an entire margin and a smooth, shiny surface. Cells are usually stout rods (0·6–1·0 × 2·0–3·0 pm) with ellipsoidal spores (0·6–1·0 × 0·8–1·6 pm) situated subterminally and in ageing cells paracentrally to sometimes lateral. Spores do not cause swelling of the sporangium. Strains of this species hydrolyse casein, gelatin and MUG. Some strains, but not the type strain, hydrolyse Tween 40 and 60. No hydrolysis of starch or pullulan is observed, phenylalanine is not deaminated and reduction of nitrate is variable among strains. Growth occurs at pH 7·0, with an optimum at about pH 8·0. Strains grow in the temperature range from 10 to 37 °C, with the type strain failing to grow at 37 °C. All strains tolerate up to 9% NaCl, while strain PN-111 grows at 12% NaCl. Carbohydrate utilization pattern shows growth on lactose, but not on glycogen or N- acetylglucosamine. The chromosomal DNA composition is between 40·6 and 41·7 mol % G + C.Source: soil.Type strain of this species is PN-109 ( = DSM 8722).
DMBP00002867	AbstractA Gram-stain positive, long, rod-shaped, motile, and spore-forming bacterium (MEB199T) was isolated from a sediment sample collected from Lonar Lake, India. The strain was oxidase and catalase positive. The strain grew optimally at pH 10, NaCl concentration of 3.5% at 37°C. The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, anteiso-C15:0, and iso-C17:0. The peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP). Phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylglycerol were the major polar lipids of MEB199T. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain MEB199T belonged to the family Bacillaceae and exhibited a distinctive position among the members of the genus Alkalihalobacillus (Ahb.). Strain MEB199T shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Alkalihalobacillus alkalinitrilicus ANL-iso4T (98.36%), whereas with type species Ahb. alcalophilus DSM 485T, it is 94.91%, indicating that strain MEB199T is distinctly related to the genus Alkalihalobacillus. The G + C content of genomic DNA was 36.47 mol%. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) (23.6%) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) (81%) values between strain MEB199T and Ahb. alkalinitrilicus ANL-iso4T confirmed the novelty of this new species. The pairwise identity based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence between the species of genus Alkalihalobacillus ranges from 87.4 to 99.81% indicating the heterogeneity in the genus. The different phylogenetic analysis based on the genome showed that the members of the genus Alkalihalobacillus separated into eight distinct clades. The intra-clade average amino acid identity (AAI) and percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) range from 52 to 68% and 37 to 59%, respectively, which are interspersed on the intra-genera cutoff values; therefore, we reassess the taxonomy of genus Alkalihalobacillus. The phenotypic analysis also corroborated the differentiation between these clades. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, genomic indices, and phenotypic traits, we propose the reclassification of the genus Alkalihalobacillus into seven new genera for which the names Alkalihalobacterium gen. nov., Halalkalibacterium gen. nov., Halalkalibacter gen. nov., Shouchella gen. nov., Pseudalkalibacillus gen. nov., Alkalicoccobacillus gen. nov., and Alkalihalophilus gen. nov. are proposed and provide an emended description of Alkalihalobacillus sensu stricto. Also, we propose the Ahb. okuhidensis as a heterotypic synonym of Alkalihalobacillus halodurans. Based on the polyphasic taxonomic analysis, strain MEB199T represents a novel species of newly proposed genus for which the name Alkalihalobacterium elongatum gen. nov. sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MEB199T (= MCC 2982T, = JCM 33704T, = NBRC 114256T, = CGMCC 1.17254T).10.3389/fmicb.2021.722369

DMBP00002901	AbstractA yellow-coloured, Gram-staining-negative, motile and rod shaped bacterium, designated strain R366T, was isolated from forest soil of Kyonggi University, South Korea. It was able to grow at 15-42 °C, pH 6.0-10.0 and with 0-4 % (w/v) NaCl concentration. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain R366T belongs to the genus Sphingopyxis and is closely related to Sphingopyxis italica SC13E-S71T (98.72 % sequence similarity), Sphingopyxis chilensis S37T (98.51 %), Sphingopyxis fribergensis Kp5.2T (98.29 %), Sphingopyxis alaskensis RB2256T (98.15 %), Sphingopyxis ginsengisoli Gsoli 250T (98.15 %) and Sphingopyxis taejonensis JSS54T (98.01 %). The predominant respiratory quinone was ubiquinone-10, and the major polyamine was spermidine. The polar lipid profile revealed the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and sphingoglycolipid. The predominant fatty acids of strain R366T were summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c), summed feature 3 (C16 : 1ω7c and/or C16 : 1ω6c), C17 : 1ω6c, C16 : 0, C18 : 1ω7c 11-methyl and C14 : 0 2-OH. The genomic DNA G+C content of this novel strain was 65.1 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness between strain R366T and Sphingopyxisitalica DSM 25229T, Sphingopyxischilensis KCCM 41918T, Sphingopyxisalaskensis KCCM 41983T, Sphingopyxisginsengisoli KACC 13918T and Sphingopyxistaejonensis KACC 12341T was 51.7, 45.3, 39.0, 41.3 and 44.7 %, respectively. The morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analyses clearly distinguished this strain from its closest phylogenetic neighbours. Thus, strain R366T represents a novel species of the genus Sphingopyxis, for which the name Sphingopyxis solisilvae sp. nov. is proposed.

Comm. 1954, 152....................................................................................a.ga.lac’ti.ae. Gr. n. agalactia want of milk; N.L. gen. n. agalactiae of agalactia.Constitutes Lancefield’s (1933) group B streptococci.Cells are spherical or ovoid, 0.6–1.2 μm in diameter, occurring in chains of seldom less than four cells and frequentlyvery long. Grows readily on blood agar and exhibits various types of hemolysis viz. typical β-hemolysis, but with anarrow zone, α-double zone, or no hemolysis. Some strainsproduce a characteristic opaque β-hemolysis, probably dueto a soluble hemolysin with low hemolytic activity. Thishemolysin is different from both hemolysin O and S. TheCAMP factor (Christie et al., 1944) produced by most groupB streptococci binds to erythrocyte membrane altered byStaphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C and this resultsin enhanced lysis of erythrocytes. The CAMP factor is nottotally specific for group B streptococci since it has also beenfound in group C, F, and G streptococci. Many strains cangrow in media containing 40% bile. Some strains produce ayellow, orange, or brick-red pigment and production may beenhanced by addition of starch to the medium or by anaerobic incubation. Energy-yielding metabolism is fermentativewith lactic acid constituting the major end product. Thefinal pH in glucose broth is 4.2–4.8. Acid is produce fromglucose, maltose, ribose, sucrose, and trehalose. Glycerol isfermented only aerobically. Acid from lactose and salicinare variable characteristics of this species. Acid is not produced from xylose, arabinose, raffinose, inulin, mannitol, orsorbitol. Strains produce alkaline phosphatase. Productionof α-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase are variable characteristics. Pyrrolidonyl arylamidase is not produced. Acetoin(Voges–Proskauer reaction) has been reported both as apositive (Hardie, 1986a) and as a negative (Facklam, 2002)characteristic. Strains hydrolyze arginine and hippurate butnot esculin.The group B-specific polysaccharide antigen is composedof rhamnose, N-acetylglucosamine, and galactose (Curtis andKrause, 1964). Serological cross-reaction may be encounteredwith group G strains of streptococci due to the presence ofrhamnose in the immunodominant portion of the polysaccharides. The peptidoglycan type is Lys–Ala1–3(Ser)Serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, and VI are recognized basedon the capsular polysaccharide antigen and surface proteinantigen. The serotype-specific capsular polysaccharides areessential for pathogenesis (Rubens et al., 1987). Types I, II,III, and V cause the majority of neonatal disease in humans(Baker, 2000; Blumberg et al., 1996). Serotype III strains areimportant in that they cause approximately 60% of invasiveneonatal infections although they represent only approximately one-third of strains isolated from asymptomaticallycolonized individuals (Baker and Barrett, 1974; Dillon et al.,1987).10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00612

N.L. adj. anginosus pertaining to angina.Cells are cocci, small (0.5–1.0 μm diameter), forming short chains. Colonies on blood (horse) agar are 0.5–2.0 mm in diameter, white or translucent, convex, and entire; some strains produce colonies that are 0.5–1.0 mm in diameter, white, and matte. Growth is reduced under aerobic conditions, is frequently enhanced by the addition of CO2 with some strains requiring anaerobic incubation. Most strains give α-hemolysis or no hemolysis on blood agar with some strains giving β-hemolysis. No extra-cellular polysaccharides are produced on sucrose-containing medium. Strains produce alkaline phosphatase and leucine arylamidase.Virtually all strains produce β-glucosidase. α-Galactosidase and α-glucosidase are sometimes produced. Strains do not produce α-fucosidase, β-fucosidase, β-glucuronidase,β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, β-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase, or sialidase. Over 50% of strains have been reported to produce β-galactosidase when incubated in CO2 (Ahmet et al., 1995). Acid is produced from amygdalin, arbutin, maltose, and glucose, and is frequently produced from cellobiose, lactose, salicin, and trehalose.Strains of this species that are able to produce acid from mannitol, raffinose, and melibiose are frequently associated with the human female genital tract. Strains do not fermentarabinose, glycerol, glycogen inulin, ribose, sorbitol, or tagatose. Arginine and esculin are hydrolyzed but urea and hippurate are not. Acetoin is produced (Voges–Proskauer reaction). Hydrogen peroxide production is sometimes detected. Hyaluronidase is produced by a few strains only.The majority of strains are either serologically ungroupableor belong to Lancefield group F although strains can possess the Lancefield group A, C, or G antigen. The cell-wallpeptidoglycan type is Lys–Ala1–3. Strains are isolated fromthe human oral cavity, upper respiratory tract, and vagina.

DMBP00003096	A gram-negative, white-pigmented, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium, designated as strain NIBRBAC000500504T, was isolated from soil in Jangsu, Korea. Optimal growth of this strain was observed at 25 °C, pH 7.0, and in the presence of 0% (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain NIBRBAC000500504T belonged to the genus Mesorhizobium and was closely related to Mesorhizobium shangrilense LMG 24762T (98.3% sequence similarity), Mesorhizobium australicum LMG 24608T (98.2%), Mesorhizobium qingshengii LMG 26793T (98.1%), Mesorhizobium ciceri ATCC 51585T (98.0%), Mesorhizobium loti DSM 2626T (98.0%), Mesorhizobium sophorae LMG 28223T (97.9%), Mesorhizobium waitakense LMG 28227T (97.8%), and Mesorhizobium cantuariense LMG 28225T (97.8%). Next-generation sequencing analysis indicated that the genome of strain NIBRBAC000500504T comprised a circular chromosome (5,731,152 bp, G+C content: 63.26%) and a plasmid (293,638 bp, G+C content: 61.39%) with 5672 coding sequences, 50 tRNAs, and 6 rRNAs. The major respiratory isoprenoid quinone was Q10; the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine; the major fatty acids were summed feature 8 (comprising C18:1 ω7c/C18:1 ω6c), C19:0 cyclo ω8c, C16:0, and C18:1 ω7c 11-methyl; and the G+C content of the genomic DNA was 62.9 mol%. The DNA-DNA relatedness values between NIBRBAC000500504T and its closest type strains were low. On the basis of these polyphasic taxonomic data, it is proposed that strain NIBRBAC000500504T represents a novel species of the genus Mesorhizobium, with the type strain being NIBRBAC000500504T (= KCTC 72278T = JCM 33432T).DOI:10.1007/s10482-020-01435-0

DMBP00003112	AbstractThe species Mesorhizobim loti was isolated from nodules of Lotus corniculatus and its type strain deposited in several collections. Some of these type strains, such as those deposited in the USDA and ATCC collections before 1990, are not coincident with the original strain, NZP 2213T, deposited in the NZP culture collection. The analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that strains USDA 3471T and ATCC 33669T formed independent branches from that occupied by Mesorhizobium loti NZP 2213T and related to those occupied by Mesorhizobium opportunistum WSM2075T and Mesorhizobium huakuii IFO 15243T, respectively, with 99.9 % similarity in both cases. However, the analysis of concatenated recA, atpD and glnII genes with similarities lower than 96, 98 and 94 %, respectively, between strains USDA 3471T and M. opportunistum WSM2075T and between strains ATCC 33669T and M. huakuii IFO 15243T, indicated that the strains USDA 3471T and ATCC 33669T represent different species of the genus Mesorhizobium. These results were confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments and phenotypic characterization. Therefore, the two strains were reclassified as representatives of the two species Mesorhizobium erdmanii sp. nov. (type strain USDA 3471T = CECT 8631T = LMG 17826t2T) and Mesorhizobium jarvisii sp. nov. (type strain ATCC 33669T = CECT 8632T = LMG 28313T).10.1099/ijs.0.000164
DMBP00003113	AbstractTwo bacterial strains, HKU50T and HKU46, were isolated in Hong Kong from the blood culture and the peritoneal dialysis effluent of two patients. The strains are Gram-stain-positive, acid-fast, non-motile, non-sporulating bacilli. They grow on Columbia agar with 5 % defibrinated sheep blood and brain-heart infusion agar under aerobic conditions with 5 % CO2 at 37 °C as pink-to-orange, non-Haemolytic colonies. The strains are catalase-positive and oxidase-negative, and have a unique biochemical profile distinguishable from other closely related species. DNA sequencing revealed that both isolates possessed multiple intra-genomic 16S rRNA gene copies (99.8-100 % sequence identities to Gordonia lacunae NRRL B-24551T and Gordonia terrae NRRL B-16283T). Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, secA1 and gyrB showed that the two isolates formed a distinct branch within the genus Gordonia and were most closely related to G. lacunae and G. terrae. DNA-DNA hybridization demonstrated ≤53.7 % and ≤49.4 % DNA relatedness between the two isolates and G. lacunae, and between the two isolates and G. terrae, respectively. Hierarchical cluster analysis of MALDI-TOF MS main spectrum profiles showed that strains HKU50T and HKU46 were closely related to each other, but were distinct from G. lacunae, G. terrae, or any other species of the genus Gordonia in the Bruker database. The chemotaxonomic traits of the two strains were highly similar, and the major fatty acids were summed feature 4 (iso-C15 : 0 2-OH/C16 : 1trans-9), C16 : 0, C18 : 1cis-9, and tuberculostearic acid. A novel species named Gordonia hongkongensis sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate strains HKU50T and HKU46, with strain HKU50T (=CCOS 955T=CIP 111027T=NBRC 111234T=NCCP 16210T) as the type strain.10.1099/ijsem.0.001292

DMBP00003120	AbstractA novel Gram-stain-positive, strictly aerobic, short rod-shaped bacterium, designated 2CT, was isolated from freshly packaged microfiltered milk. This strain was able to grow within the NaCl concentration range of 0-5 % (w/v), temperature range of 8-37 °C (optimally at 30 °C) and at pH 6.0-10.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain 2CT was closely related to species of the genus Microbacterium, with the highest sequence similarity (99.2 %) to Microbacterium lacticum DSM 20427T as well as Microbacterium flavum DSM 18909T (=YM18-098T). The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA genes showed that strain 2CT clustered with M. flavum DSM 18909T. However, the phylogenetic tree based on concatenated 16S rRNA and four housekeeping genes showed that strain 2CT clustered with M. lacticum DSM 20427T. Furthermore, the phylogenomic tree showed that strain 2CT clustered with M. lacticum DSM 20427T and M. flavum DSM 18909T. The major respiratory quinones were MK-10, MK-11 and MK-12. The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C16 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0. The polar lipid composition of strain 2CT consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, three unidentified glycolipids and two unidentified lipids. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type was a variant of B1α {Gly} [l-Lys] d-Glu-l-Lys, with the amino acids lysine, glycine, alanine and glutamic acid. The whole-cell sugars consisted of galactose, glucose, ribose and minor amounts of rhamnose. In addition, strain 2CT showed a glycolyl-type cell wall. The genomic DNA G+C content was 69.8mol%, while the average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values with the closely related Microbacterium species were below the recognized thresholds of 95-96 % ANI and 70 % DDH for species definition. Based on the phenotypic and genotypic data, strain 2CT (=LMG 32277T=CECT 30329T) is considered to represent a new species, for which the name Microbacterium paulum sp. nov. is proposed.Keywords: Microbacteriaceae; Microbacterium paulum; microfiltered milk.10.1099/ijsem.0.005119

DMBP00003124	AbstractTwo Gram-positive strains isolated from cysts of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana were subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison and composition of isoprenoid quinones, peptidoglycan and fatty acids, these organisms are members of the genus Exiguobacterium. Both strains showed 95.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to one another. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain 8N(T) and 9AN(T) were 97.5% and 98.9% similar to those of Exiguobacterium aurantiacum DSM 6208(T) and Exiguobacterium undae DSM 14481(T), respectively. Based on differences in chemotaxonomic and physiological characteristics, results of DNA-DNA hybridization and automated riboprinting, two novel species of the genus Exiguobacterium are proposed, Exiguobacterium mexicanum sp. nov. (type strain 8N(T)=DSM 16483(T)=CIP 108859(T)) and Exiguobacterium artemiae sp. nov. (type strain 9AN(T)=DSM 16484(T)=CIP 108858(T)).10.1016/j.syapm.2005.09.007

DMBP00003135	AbstractThe genus Bacillus, harbouring 293 species/subspecies, constitutes a phylogenetically incoherent group. In the absence of reliable means for grouping known Bacillus species into distinct clades, restricting the placement of new species into this genus has proven difficult. To clarify the evolutionary relationships among Bacillus species, 352 available genome sequences from the family Bacillaceae were used to perform comprehensive phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses. Four phylogenetic trees were reconstructed based on multiple datasets of proteins including 1172 core Bacillaceae proteins, 87 proteins conserved within the phylum Firmicutes, GyrA-GyrB-RpoB-RpoC proteins, and UvrD-PolA proteins. All trees exhibited nearly identical branching of Bacillus species and consistently displayed six novel monophyletic clades encompassing 5-23 Bacillus species (denoted as the Simplex, Firmus, Jeotgali, Niacini, Fastidiosus and Alcalophilus clades), interspersed with other Bacillaceae species. Species from these clades also generally grouped together in 16S rRNA gene trees. In parallel, our comparative genomic analyses of Bacillus species led to the identification of 36 molecular markers comprising conserved signature indels in protein sequences that are specifically shared by the species from these six observed clades, thus reliably demarcating these clades based on multiple molecular synapomorphies. Based on the strong evidence from multiple lines of investigations supporting the existence of these six distinct 'Bacillus' clades, we propose the transfer of species from these clades into six novel Bacillaceae genera viz. Peribacillus gen. nov., Cytobacillus gen. nov., Mesobacillus gen. nov., Neobacillus gen. nov., Metabacillus gen. nov. and Alkalihalobacillus gen. nov. These results represent an important step towards clarifying the phylogeny/taxonomy of the genus Bacillus.10.1099/ijsem.0.003775

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain DSL-17T was related to members of the genus Metabacillus and shared the highest similarity with Metabacillus litoralis SW-211T (98.6 %), followed by Metabacillus halosaccharovorans E33T (97.9 %), Metabacillus crassostreae JSM 100118T (97.7 %), Metabacillus niabensis 4T19T (97.7 %) and Metabacillus malikii NCCP-662T (97.5 %). 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between strain DSL-17T and other members of the genus Metabacillus were below 96.6 %. The sole respiratory quinone was MK-7. Strain DSL-17T had a cell-wall peptidoglycan based on meso-diaminopimelic acid. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), three unidentified glycolipids and six unidentified lipids. The strain had iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C14 : 0, C16 : 0 and iso-C16 : 0 as major fatty acids. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 35.7 mol%. The combined genotypic and phenotypic data indicated that strain DSL-17T represents a novel species of the genus Metabacillus, for which the name Metabacillus sediminilitoris sp. nov. is proposed The type strain is DSL-17T (=MCCC 1K03777T=DSM 109843T).10.1099/ijsem.0.004392
DMBP00003137	AbstractA novel bacterial strain, designated PR1016AT, was isolated from a car air conditioning system. This rod-shaped strain showed catalase and oxidase activities, was aerobic and methylotrophic, and had a reddish pink colour. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain PR1016AT was 70.2 mol%, as determined by genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity showed that strain PR1016AT was most closely related to Methylobacterium aquaticum GR16T (98.86 %), M. variabile GR3T (98.43 %), M. platani PMB 02T (98.36 %) and M. tarhaniae N4211T (98.14 %). The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain PR1016AT and M. aquaticum GR16T, M. platani PMB02T and M. variabile GR3T were 88.61, 88.14 and 87.88 %, and 36.4, 35.8 and 34.7 %, respectively. Numerous insertion sequences are present in the genome of strain PR1016AT, which has a larger genome than the four Methylobacterium species described above. Cells grew at 18-42 °C (optimum, 30 °C), at pH 4.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0-1.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0 %). The major respiratory quinone was Q10. Fatty acid methyl ester analysis revealed that summed feature 8 (C18 : 1ω7c and/or C18 : 1ω6c) was the predominant cellular fatty acid in strain PR1016AT. Two-dimensional TLC indicated that the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. The genotypic and phenotypic characteristics indicate that strain PR1016AT represents a novel species of the genus Methylobacterium, for which the name Methylobacterium currus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is PR1016AT (=KACC 19662T=JCM 32670T).Keywords: Alphaproteobacteria; Methylobacterium; taxonomy.10.1099/ijsem.0.003045

DMBP00003140	AbstractA non-motile, straight-rod-shaped, Gram-stain-positive and facultative anaerobic bacterium (i.e., strain G1T) was isolated from production waters from an Algerian oilfield. Growth was observed in the presence of 0.3-3.5 % (w/v) NaCl, at 20-50 °C and at pH 6.0-9.0. Results of phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain G1T belonged to the genus Microbacterium. Strain G1 T was closely related to Microbacterium oxydans (DSM 20578T) and Microbacterium maritypicum (DSM 12512T) with 99.8 % sequence similarity and to Microbacterium saperdae (DSM 20169T) with 99.6 % sequence similarity. Strain G1 T contained MK9, MK10, MK11, MK12 and MK13 as respiratory quinones, and phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and glycolipid as the major polar lipids. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0, iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C17:0. The estimated DNA G+C content was 69.57 mol% based on its draft genome sequence. Genome annotation of strain G1T predicted the presence of 3511 genes, of which 3483 were protein-coding and 47 were tRNA genes. The DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) values between strain G1T and M. oxydans (DSM 20578T) and M. maritypicum (DSM 12512T) were in both cases far below the respective species boundary thresholds (27.5 and 28.0 % for DDH; and 84.40 and 84.82% for ANI, respectively). Based on the data presented above, strain G1T was considered to represent a novel species for which the name Microbacterium algeriense is proposed with the type strain G1T (=DSM 109018T=LMG 31276T).Keywords: Microbacterium algeriense sp. nov.; actinobacteria; oilfield; production water.10.1099/ijsem.0.004434

DMBP00003151	AbstractStrains previously identified as Klebsiella oxytocaphylogroup Ko6 were characterized by rpoB, gyrA and rrs gene sequencing, genome-sequence based average nucleotide identity analysis and their biochemical characteristics. rpoB and gyrA sequencing demonstrated that the Ko6 strains formed a well-demarcated sequence cluster related to, but distinct from, Klebsiella oxytoca (which includes strains previously labelled as K. oxytocaphylogroup Ko2) and Klebsiella michiganensis (Ko1). The average nucleotide identity values of Ko6 with K. oxytoca and K. michiganensis were 91.2 and 93.47 %, respectively. The inability to metabolize melezitose differentiated most of the Ko6 strains from K. oxytoca and K. michiganensis. Based on its genetic and phenotypic characteristics, we propose the name Klebsiella grimontii for the Ko6 sequence cluster, with strain 06D021T (=CIP111401T, DSM 105630T) as the type strain. Strains of Klebsiella grimontii were isolated from human blood cultures, wound infections, antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis and faecal carriage.Keywords: Klebsiella; antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis; beta-lactamase; nosocomial infections; phylogeny; taxonomy.10.1099/ijsem.0.002517

He contributed decisively todisprove the theory of the spontaneous generation of microbes).The description is based on 14 strains. Cells are Gramnegative, non-motile, non-spore-forming, straight, rod-shapedand capsulated. Colonies are smooth, circular, white, domeshaped, and glistening. The general characteristics are asdescribed for the genus Klebsiella. Indole-positive, ureasenegative, ONPG-positive, Voges–Proskauer test positive, lysinedecarboxylase positive, and ornithine decarboxylase negative.They can be distinguished from the other members of K. oxytocacomplex by the characteristics listed in Table 3. They aredistinguishable from K. grimontii by the ability to fermentD-melezitose and inability to ferment alpha-keto-glutaric acid,and from the remaining K. oxytoca groups by the uniqueweak ability to ferment glyoxylic acid. K. pasteurii isolates wererecovered from feces of cows, turtles and humans.The type strain is strain SPARK_836_C1T(=SB6412, CIP111696T, and DSM 109530), isolated in 2017 from the feces ofa patient in Pavia, Italy.

L. adj. varius different, differing, various,L. suffix n. -cola inhabitant , N.L. fem./masc. n. variicolainhabitant of different places):The isolates of this new species are Gram negativerods. They grow in acidic Koser citrate, in MacConkey,in LB, in YM and in PY media. They form colonies onMacConkey medium within one day. They are nitrogenfixing bacteria. They do not ferment adonitol (a distinctive characteristic from K. pneumoniae) but many fermentrhamnose. They grow at 37 °C and at pH 5.6–7. They areabundant in plants [31] and represent less than 10% ofthe clinical Klebsiella isolates previously considered asK. pneumoniae.They correspond to the isolates that are consideredwithin the sequencing cluster A reported here and are distinguished from K. pneumoniae and other Klebsiellaspecies by their sequences of rpoB, gyrA, mdh, phoE,infB and nifH genes and by their low levels of DNADNA hybridization. The pathogenicity of the plant isolates from K. variicola has not been determined. As otherstrains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, K. variicola strains are susceptible to nalidixic acid but naturallyresistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin but not in thepresence of clavulanic acid that inhibits penicillinase.Most of them are sensitive to gentamicin 10 mgl–1 andthey are sensitive to spectinomycin 250 mgl–1.The type strain F2R9T has the characteristics of thespecies.

DMBP00003165	AbstractA facultatively anaerobic, alkaliphilic, Gram-stain-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain 12/1(T), isolated from alkaline wastewater drained sludge of a beverage industry facility located near New Delhi, India, was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain 12/1(T) belonged to the genus Exiguobacterium and was most closely related to Exiguobacterium aurantiacum DSM 6208(T) (99.46 %), E. aquaticum IMTB-3094(T) (99.18 %), E. mexicanum 8N(T) (99.06 %), E. profundum 10C(T) (98.17 %), E. aestuarii TF-16(T) (98.1 %) and E. marinum TF-80(T) (98.03 %). The DNA G+C content of strain 12/1(T) was 55.6 mol%, major respiratory isoprenoid quinone was MK-7, major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine and the cell-wall peptidoglycan was of the A3α l-Lys-Gly type, characteristics consistent with its affiliation to the genus Exiguobacterium. Strain 12/1(T) showed levels of DNA-DNA hybridization of less than 70 % with the closely related species of the genus Exiguobacterium. Overall, the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data presented in this study suggest that strain 12/1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Exiguobacterium, for which the name Exiguobacterium alkaliphilum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 12/1(T) ( = CCM 8459(T) = DSM 21148(T)).10.1099/ijs.0.039123-0
DMBP00003166	AbstractStrain HHS 31(T), a Gram-positive, motile, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, alkaliphilic bacterium, was isolated from the melt water of a glacier. Phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics indicate that strain HHS 31(T) is related to species of the genus Exiguobacterium. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between HHS 31(T) and strains of known species confirm that it is closely related to members of the genus Exiguobacterium (93-99 %) and that it exhibits >97 % similarity with Exiguobacterium acetylicum DSM 20416(T) (98.9 %), Exiguobacterium antarcticum DSM 14480(T) (98.0 %), Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans JCM 12280(T) (97.9 %) and Exiguobacterium undae DSM 14481(T) (97.4 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence further confirms the affiliation of HHS 31(T) with the genus Exiguobacterium. However, the levels of DNA-DNA relatedness between HHS 31(T) and E. oxidotolerans JCM 12280(T), E. acetylicum DSM 20416(T), E. undae DSM 14481(T) and E. antarcticum DSM 14480(T) are 50, 63, 67 and 28 %, respectively. Strain HHS 31(T) also differs from these four closely related species in terms of a number of phenotypic traits. The phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic data suggest that HHS 31(T) merits the status of a novel species, for which the name Exiguobacterium indicum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HHS 31(T) (=LMG 23471(T)=IAM 15368(T)).10.1099/ijs.0.64508-0
DMBP00003167	AbstractA facultatively anaerobic, halotolerant, moderately thermophilic and non-sporulating bacterium, designated strain 10C(T), was isolated from deep-sea hydrothermal vent samples collected on the 13 degrees N East Pacific Rise at a depth of approximately 2600 m. Cells of strain 10C(T) were Gram-positive, motile rods, and grew optimally at 45 degrees C (range 12-49 degrees C), pH 7.0 (range pH 5.5-9.5) and 0-2 % NaCl (range 0-11 %). (+)-L-Lactate was the main organic acid detected from carbohydrate fermentation with traces of formate, acetate and ethanol. Strain 10C(T) was catalase-positive, oxidase-negative and reduced nitrate to nitrite under anaerobic conditions. The DNA G+C content was 50.4 mol%. Its closest phylogenetic relatives were Exiguobacterium aestuarii TF-16(T) and Exiguobacterium marinum TF-80(T) (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity >99 %). However, strain 10C(T) differed genotypically from these two Exiguobacterium species as indicated by DNA-DNA relatedness data. Therefore, on the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain 10C(T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Exiguobacterium, for which the name Exiguobacterium profundum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 10C(T) (=CCUG 50949(T)=DSM 17289(T)).

DMBP00003175	AbstractTo clarify the evolutionary relationships and classification of Bacillus species, comprehensive phylogenomic and comparative analyses were performed on >300 Bacillus/Bacillaceae genomes. Multiple genomic-scale phylogenetic trees were initially reconstructed to identify different monophyletic clades of Bacillus species. In parallel, detailed analyses were performed on protein sequences of genomes to identify conserved signature indels (CSIs) that are specific for each of the identified clades. We show that in different reconstructed trees, most of the Bacillus species, in addition to the Subtilis and Cereus clades, consistently formed 17 novel distinct clades. Additionally, some Bacillus species reliably grouped with the genera Alkalicoccus, Caldalkalibacillus, Caldibacillus, Salibacterium and Salisediminibacterium. The distinctness of identified Bacillus species clades is independently strongly supported by 128 identified CSIs which are unique characteristics of these clades, providing reliable means for their demarcation. Based on the strong phylogenetic and molecular evidence, we are proposing that these 17 Bacillus species clades should be recognized as novel genera, with the names Alteribacter gen. nov., Ectobacillus gen. nov., Evansella gen. nov., Ferdinandcohnia gen. nov., Gottfriedia gen. nov., Heyndrickxia gen. nov., Lederbergia gen. nov., Litchfieldia gen. nov., Margalitia gen. nov., Niallia gen. nov., Priestia gen. nov., Robertmurraya gen. nov., Rossellomorea gen. nov., Schinkia gen. nov., Siminovitchia gen. nov., Sutcliffiella gen. nov. and Weizmannia gen. nov. We also propose to transfer 'Bacillus kyonggiensis' to Robertmurraya kyonggiensis sp. nov. (type strain: NB22=JCM 17569T=DSM 26768). Additionally, we report 31 CSIs that are unique characteristics of either the members of the Subtilis clade (containing the type species B. subtilis) or the Cereus clade (containing B. anthracis and B. cereus). As most Bacillus species which are not part of these two clades can now be assigned to other genera, we are proposing an emended description of the genus Bacillus to restrict it to only the members of the Subtilis and Cereus clades.Keywords: classification of Bacillus species; conserved signature indels; emendation of genus Bacillus; genus Bacillus and the family Bacillaceae; novel Bacillaceae genera Alteribacter, Ectobacillus, Evansella, Ferdinandcohnia, Gottfriedia, Heyndrickxia, Lederbergia, Litchfieldia, Margalitia, Niallia, Priestia, Robertmurraya, Rossellomorea, Schinkia, Siminovitchia, Sutcliffiella and Weizmannia; phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses.10.1099/ijsem.0.004475

DMBP00003178	AbstractA fusiform bacterium with 3 to 14 multiple bipolar sheathed flagella and periplasmic fibers wrapped around the cell was isolated from the liver, bile, and lower intestine of aged, inbred mice. The bacteria grew at 37 and 42 degrees C under microaerophilic conditions, rapidly hydrolyzed urea, were catalase and oxidase positive, reduced nitrate to nitrite, did not hydrolyze indoxyl acetate or hippurate, and were resistant to both cephalothin and nalidixic acid but sensitive to metronidazole. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the organism was classified as a novel helicobacter, Helicobacter bilis. This new helicobacter, like Helicobacter hepaticus, colonizes the bile, liver, and intestine of mice. Although the organism is associated with multifocal chronic hepatitis, further studies are required to ascertain whether H. bilis is responsible for causing chronic hepatitis and/or hepatocellular tumors in mice10.1128/jcm.33.2.445-454.1995

DMBP00003189	AbstractThe genus Bacillus, harbouring 293 species/subspecies, constitutes a phylogenetically incoherent group. In the absence of reliable means for grouping known Bacillus species into distinct clades, restricting the placement of new species into this genus has proven difficult. To clarify the evolutionary relationships among Bacillus species, 352 available genome sequences from the family Bacillaceae were used to perform comprehensive phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses. Four phylogenetic trees were reconstructed based on multiple datasets of proteins including 1172 core Bacillaceae proteins, 87 proteins conserved within the phylum Firmicutes, GyrA-GyrB-RpoB-RpoC proteins, and UvrD-PolA proteins. All trees exhibited nearly identical branching of Bacillus species and consistently displayed six novel monophyletic clades encompassing 5-23 Bacillus species (denoted as the Simplex, Firmus, Jeotgali, Niacini, Fastidiosus and Alcalophilus clades), interspersed with other Bacillaceae species. Species from these clades also generally grouped together in 16S rRNA gene trees. In parallel, our comparative genomic analyses of Bacillus species led to the identification of 36 molecular markers comprising conserved signature indels in protein sequences that are specifically shared by the species from these six observed clades, thus reliably demarcating these clades based on multiple molecular synapomorphies. Based on the strong evidence from multiple lines of investigations supporting the existence of these six distinct 'Bacillus' clades, we propose the transfer of species from these clades into six novel Bacillaceae genera viz. Peribacillus gen. nov., Cytobacillus gen. nov., Mesobacillus gen. nov., Neobacillus gen. nov., Metabacillus gen. nov. and Alkalihalobacillus gen. nov. These results represent an important step towards clarifying the phylogeny/taxonomy of the genus Bacillus.10.1099/ijsem.0.003775

All trees exhibited nearly identical branching of Bacillus species and consistently displayed six novel monophyletic clades encompassing 5-23 Bacillus species (denoted as the Simplex, Firmus, Jeotgali, Niacini, Fastidiosus and Alcalophilus clades), interspersed with other Bacillaceae species. Species from these clades also generally grouped together in 16S rRNA gene trees. In parallel, our comparative genomic analyses of Bacillus species led to the identification of 36 molecular markers comprising conserved signature indels in protein sequences that are specifically shared by the species from these six observed clades, thus reliably demarcating these clades based on multiple molecular synapomorphies. Based on the strong evidence from multiple lines of investigations supporting the existence of these six distinct 'Bacillus' clades, we propose the transfer of species from these clades into six novel Bacillaceae genera viz. Peribacillus gen. nov., Cytobacillus gen. nov., Mesobacillus gen. nov., Neobacillus gen. nov., Metabacillus gen. nov. and Alkalihalobacillus gen. nov. These results represent an important step towards clarifying the phylogeny/taxonomy of the genus Bacillus.10.1099/ijsem.0.003775

(Utilization of l-arabinose, d-xylose, d-glucose, d-mannose, d-fructose, galactose, trehalose, citric acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and methylamine differs among the strains [Table 4].) Vitamins and amino acids are not required for growth. (Some strains require calcium pantothenate as a stimulant [Table 2].) Ammonia, nitrate, and urea are assimilated. Urease, oxidase, and catalase are produced. Aerobic. Metabolism is strictly respiratory and not fermentative.Good growth occurs between pH 6.0 and 8.0. Good growth occurs at 30°C but not at 37°C.

Bacteriochlorophyll is formed under specific cultural conditions (Fig. 6). Methanol is utilized by the serine pathway with formaldehyde incorporation, and the complete tricarboxylic acid cycle is functional (1).The type strain is TK 0001 (= DSM 1337 = NCIB 9399), which was isolated from Polish soil by Janota in 1950. This strain was deposited in the National Collection of Industrial Bacteria, Aberdeen, Scotland, as “Flavobacterium extorquens” by C. Bassalik in 1960.According to this study and other investigations, Pseudomonas rhodos Heuman 1962 (15), Pseudomonas radiora Ito and Iizuka 1971 (21), and Pseudomonas mesophilica Austin and Goodfellow (2) should be identified as strains of Protomonas extorquens.The bacteria belonging to Protomonas extorquens differ from each other with respect to oxidative production of acids from sugars (Table 3), assimilation of carbon compounds (Table 4), requirements for vitamins (Table 2), pH for growth (Table 2), temperature for growth (Table 2), and electropho-retic patterns of enzymes (45). This species was divided into three subgroups based on assimilation of carbon compounds (44), and this grouping agreed well with the grouping based on an electrophoretic comparison of enzymes (45). Subgroups 1 and 2 correspond to cluster 10, and subgroup 3 corresponds to cluster 11 of Green and Bousfield (14). However, these differences were recognized as intraspecific.Therefore, we propose biovars 1, 2, and 3 of Protomonas extorquens. Protomonas extorquens TK 0001T (= DSM 1337T = NCIB 9399T) is a representative strain of biovar 1, Protomonas extorquens TK 0010 (= ATCC 14821) is a representative strain of biovar 2, and Protomonas extorquens TK 0035 (= ATCC 27329 = I AM 12099) is a representative strain of biovar 3. Biovar 1 contains TK 0001 to TK 0005; biovar 2 contains TK 0006 to TK 0033; and biovar 3 contains TK 0034 to TK 0045.

DMBP00003208	AbstractA Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain K-1(T), was isolated from soil at a sucrose refinery in Japan. The strain grew at 9-37 °C (optimum, 30 °C) and at pH 6-11 (optimum, pH 7.0). Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain K-1(T) revealed that it was a member of the genus Microbacterium. High 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities were found between strains K-1(T) and both Microbacterium pumilum NBRC 101279(T) (99.7 %) and Microbacterium deminutum NRRL B-24453(T) (99.5 %). However, the DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain K-1(T) and M. pumilum NBRC 101279(T) and M. deminutum NRRL B-24453(T) were only 12 % and 10 %, respectively.

A polyphasic taxonomic study was performed on the new isolate. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies, this isolate belongs to the genus Microbacterium. High levels of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity were found between strain 1204T and Microbacterium enclense NIO-1002T (98.8%) and Microbacterium proteolyticum RZ36T (98.4%) respectively. However, the DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain 1204T and its closely related species M. proteolyticum DSM 27100T and M. enclense DSM 25125T were 53.9 ± 1.6 and 20.9 ± 1.5% respectively. The DNA G+C content of strain 1204T was determined to be 68.0 mol%. The major fatty acids were found to consist of anteiso-C15:0 (37.6%), iso-C16:0 (28.6%) and anteiso-C17:0 (16.6%). The predominant menaquinone was MK-11 and the polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified glycolipid and an unidentified lipid. The results of physiological and biochemical tests and minor differences in the fatty acid profiles allowed a clear phenotypic differentiation of strain 1204T from the closely related species in the genus Microbacterium.

DMBP00003235	AbstractA survey to obtain potential antagonists of pome fruit tree diseases yielded two yellow epiphytic bacterial isolates morphologically similar to Pantoea agglomerans, but showing no biocontrol activity. Whole-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and analysis of 16S rRNA gene and gyrB sequences suggested the possibility of a novel species with a phylogenetic position in either the genus Pantoea or the genus Erwinia. Multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) placed the two strains in the genus Erwinia and supported their classification as a novel species. The strains showed general phenotypic characteristics typical of this genus and results of DNA-DNA hybridizations confirmed that they represent a single novel species. Both strains showed a DNA G+C content, as determined by HPLC, of 54.5 mol% and could be discriminated from phylogenetically related species of the genus Erwinia by their ability to utilize potassium gluconate, potassium 2-ketogluconate, maltose, melibiose and raffinose. Whole-genome sequencing of strain EM595T revealed the presence of a chromosomal carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster similar to those found in species of the genera Cronobacter and Pantoea that explains the pigmentation of the strain, which is atypical for the genus Erwinia.

DMBP00003243	AbstractEscherichia fergusonii (formerly known as Enteric Group 10) and Enterobacter taylorae (formerly known as Enteric Group 19) are proposed as new species in the family Enterobacteriaceae. By DNA hybridization (32P, 60 degrees C, hydroxyapatite), strains of E. fergusonii were 90 to 97% related to the type strain (holotype) ATCC 35469. They were most closely related to Escherichia coli and more distantly related to species in other genera. E. fergusonii strains are positive for indole production, methyl red, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, and motility. They ferment D-glucose with gas production and also ferment adonitol, L-arabinose, L-rhamnose, maltose, D-xylose, trehalose, cellobiose, and D-arabitol. They are negative for Voges-Proskauer, citrate utilization (17% positive), urea hydrolysis, phenylalanine deamination, arginine dihydrolase, growth in KCN, and fermentation of lactose, sucrose, myo-inositol, D-sorbitol, raffinose, and alpha-methyl-D-glucoside. By DNA hybridization (32P, 60 degrees C, hydroxyapatite), strains of E. taylorae were 84 to 95% related to the type strain (holotype) ATCC 35317. Their nearest relative was E. cloacae, to which they were 61% related. Other named species were more distantly related. Strains of E. taylorae are positive for Voges-Proskauer, citrate utilization, arginine dihydrolase, ornithine decarboxylase, motility, growth in KCN medium, and malonate utilization. They ferment D-glucose with gas production and also ferment D-mannitol, L-arabinose, L-rhamnose, maltose, D-xylose, trehalose, and cellobiose. They are negative for indole production, methyl red, H2S production on triple sugar-iron agar, urea hydrolysis, phenylalanine deamination, lysine decarboxylase, gelatin hydrolysis, and fermentation of adonitol, i-inositol, D-sorbitol, and raffinose. Both new species occur in human clinical specimens. Two strains of E. fergusonii were isolated from blood. Five stains of E. taylorae were isolated from blood, and one was from spinal fluid. These blood and spinal fluid isolates suggest possible clinical significance, but this point requires further study.10.1128/jcm.21.1.77-81.1985Escherichia fergusoniiFarmer, Fanning, Davis, O’Hara, Riddle,Hickman-Brenner, Asbury, Lowery and Brenner1985c, 223VP (Effective publication: Farmer, Fanning,Davis, O’Hara, Riddle, Hickman-Brenner, Asbury,Lowery and Brenner 1985b, 77.)3)...................................................................................fer.gu.so’ ni.i.

DMBP00003244	We propose the name Ewingella gen.nov, for a new group in theEnterobacteriaceae. Ewingella is phenotypically distinct from all othergroups of Enterobacteriaceae. The members of this genus are lipase- anddeoxyribonuclease-negative ; Voges-Proskauer-positive ; lysine-, ornithine- and arginine-decarboxylase-negative; anaerogenic; they produceacid from glucose in the presence (and absence) of iodoacetate, but failto produce acid from L-arabinose, melibiose, raffinose, D-sorbitolor sucrose. DNA-relatedness studies (Sl-nuclease method) showed thatthe 10 Ewingella strains studied form a single DNA-hybridization groupwhich is less than 21% related to other members of the Enterobacteriaceae.This single DNA-hybridization group is named Ewingella americana sp.nov. The type strain of E. americana is CDC 1468-78 (= ATCC 33852= CIP 8194).Although the 10 strains of E. americana were isolated from clinicalsources in the United States, the clinical significance of these organismsis not known.KEY-WORDS: Ewingella, Ewingella americana, Enterobacteriaceae, DNA ;Nomenclature, New genus, New species. 10.1016/0769-2609(83)90102-3
DMBP00003245	AbstractA Gram-positive, motile, short rod-shaped, orange pigmented bacterium, designated strain IMTB-3094(T), was isolated from a water sample collected from Tikkar Tal Lake, Haryana, and subjected to detailed polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Strain IMTB-3094(T) possessed most of the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties of the genus Exiguobacterium and, based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, was assigned to this genus. Strain IMTB-3094(T) exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Exiguobacterium mexicanum MTCC 7759(T) (99.5 %) followed by Exiguobacterium aurantiacum MTCC 6414(T) (99.1 %), Exiguobacterium aestuarii MTCC 7750(T) (98.0 %), Exiguobacterium profundum MTCC 10851(T) (98.0 %) and Exiguobacterium marinum MTCC 7751(T) (98.0 %). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain IMTB-3094(T) was 53.2 mol% and a DNA-DNA relatedness study confirmed that it represents a novel species. The major fatty acids of strain IMTB-3094(T) were iso-C(17 : 0) (16.1 %), anteiso-C(13 : 0) (19.0 %), iso-C(13 : 0) (11.9 %), iso-C(15 : 0) (9.8 %) and iso-C(17 : 1) (12.7 %). The predominant quinones were MK-7 (55.0 %) and MK-6 (26.0 %) with minor amounts of MK-8 (12.0 %). Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analyses, strain IMTB-3094(T) represents a novel species of the genus Exiguobacterium, for which the name Exiguobacterium aquaticum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IMTB-3094(T) (= MTCC 10958(T) = JCM 17977(T)).
DMBP00003246	Two Gram-positive strains isolated from cysts of the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana were subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison and composition of isoprenoid quinones, peptidoglycan and fatty acids, these organisms are members of the genus Exiguobacterium. Both strains showed 95.9% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to one another. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain 8N(T) and 9AN(T) were 97.5% and 98.9% similar to those of Exiguobacterium aurantiacum DSM 6208(T) and Exiguobacterium undae DSM 14481(T), respectively. Based on differences in chemotaxonomic and physiological characteristics, results of DNA-DNA hybridization and automated riboprinting, two novel species of the genus Exiguobacterium are proposed, Exiguobacterium mexicanum sp. nov. (type strain 8N(T)=DSM 16483(T)=CIP 108859(T)) and Exiguobacterium artemiae sp. nov. (type strain 9AN(T)=DSM 16484(T)=CIP 108858(T)).10.1016/j.syapm.2005.09.007
DMBP00003247	AbstractA novel alkaliphile was isolated from a drain of a fish processing plant. The isolate grew at a pH range of 7-10. Cells were Gram-positive, facultatively aerobic, motile rods with peritrichous flagella. Colonies were orange or yellow in colour. Catalase and oxidase reactions were positive. The isolate grew in 0-12 % NaCl but not above 15 % NaCl. Its cell extract exhibited 567 times higher catalase activity than an Escherichia coli cell extract. The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C(13 : 0), anteiso-C(13 : 0), iso-C(15 : 0), iso-C(16 : 0), iso-C(17 : 0), anteiso-C(17 : 0) and iso-C(17 : 1). Its DNA G+C content was 46.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and chemotaxonomic data indicated that strain T-2-2(T) is a member of the genus Exiguobacterium. DNA-DNA hybridization revealed a low relatedness of the isolate to several phylogenetic neighbours (less than 25 %). On the basis of phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic data and DNA-DNA relatedness data, the isolate merits classification as a novel species, for which the name Exiguobacterium oxidotolerans sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is T-2-2(T) (=JCM 12280(T)=NCIMB 13980(T)).10.1099/ijs.0.63129-0
DMBP00003248	AbstractThree Gram-positive bacterial strains, 7-3, 255-15 and 190-11, previously isolated from Siberian permafrost, were characterized and taxonomically classified. These microorganisms are rod-shaped, facultative aerobic, motile with peritrichous flagella and their growth ranges are from -2.5 to 40 degrees C. The chemotaxonomic markers indicated that the three strains belong to the genus Exiguobacterium. Their peptidoglycan type was A3alpha L-Lys-Gly. The predominant menaquinone detected in all three strains was MK7. The polar lipids present were phosphatidyl-glycerol, diphosphatidyl-glycerol and phosphatidyl-ethanolamine. The major fatty acids were iso-C13:0, anteiso-C13:0, iso-C15:0, C16:0 and iso-C17:0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA and six diverse genes, gyrB (gyrase subunit B), rpoB (DNA-directed RNA polymerase beta subunit), recA (homologous recombination), csp (cold shock protein), hsp70 (ClassI-heat shock protein-chaperonin) and citC (isocitrate dehydrogenase), indicated that the strains were closely related to Exiguobacterium undae (DSM 14481(T)) and Exiguobacterium antarcticum (DSM 14480(T)). On the basis of the phenotypic characteristics, phylogenetic data and DNA-DNA reassociation data, strain 190-11 was classified as E. undae, while the other two isolates, 7-3 and 255-15, comprise a novel species, for which the name Exiguobacterium sibiricum sp. nov. is proposed.10.1007/s00792-005-0497-5

DMBP00003250	AbstractThree strains of a gram-positive catalase-negative, facultatively anaerobic coccus-shaped organism originating from human clinical samples were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Sequencing of genes encoding 16S rRNA showed that the strains are phylogenetically closely related (99.9 to 100% sequence similarity) and represent a new subline within the genus Facklamia. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from all currently described species of the genus Facklamia (viz., Facklamia hominis, Facklamia ignava, and Facklamia sourekii) by biochemical tests and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified as Facklamia languida sp. nov.

DMBP00003277	AbstractTo clarify the evolutionary relationships and classification of Bacillus species, comprehensive phylogenomic and comparative analyses were performed on >300 Bacillus/Bacillaceae genomes. Multiple genomic-scale phylogenetic trees were initially reconstructed to identify different monophyletic clades of Bacillus species. In parallel, detailed analyses were performed on protein sequences of genomes to identify conserved signature indels (CSIs) that are specific for each of the identified clades. We show that in different reconstructed trees, most of the Bacillus species, in addition to the Subtilis and Cereus clades, consistently formed 17 novel distinct clades. Additionally, some Bacillus species reliably grouped with the genera Alkalicoccus, Caldalkalibacillus, Caldibacillus, Salibacterium and Salisediminibacterium. The distinctness of identified Bacillus species clades is independently strongly supported by 128 identified CSIs which are unique characteristics of these clades, providing reliable means for their demarcation. Based on the strong phylogenetic and molecular evidence, we are proposing that these 17 Bacillus species clades should be recognized as novel genera, with the names Alteribacter gen. nov., Ectobacillus gen. nov., Evansella gen. nov., Ferdinandcohnia gen. nov., Gottfriedia gen. nov., Heyndrickxia gen. nov., Lederbergia gen. nov., Litchfieldia gen. nov., Margalitia gen. nov., Niallia gen. nov., Priestia gen. nov., Robertmurraya gen. nov., Rossellomorea gen. nov., Schinkia gen. nov., Siminovitchia gen. nov., Sutcliffiella gen. nov. and Weizmannia gen. nov. We also propose to transfer 'Bacillus kyonggiensis' to Robertmurraya kyonggiensis sp. nov. (type strain: NB22=JCM 17569T=DSM 26768). Additionally, we report 31 CSIs that are unique characteristics of either the members of the Subtilis clade (containing the type species B. subtilis) or the Cereus clade (containing B. anthracis and B. cereus). As most Bacillus species which are not part of these two clades can now be assigned to other genera, we are proposing an emended description of the genus Bacillus to restrict it to only the members of the Subtilis and Cereus clades.Keywords: classification of Bacillus species; conserved signature indels; emendation of genus Bacillus; genus Bacillus and the family Bacillaceae; novel Bacillaceae genera Alteribacter, Ectobacillus, Evansella, Ferdinandcohnia, Gottfriedia, Heyndrickxia, Lederbergia, Litchfieldia, Margalitia, Niallia, Priestia, Robertmurraya, Rossellomorea, Schinkia, Siminovitchia, Sutcliffiella and Weizmannia; phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses.10.1099/ijsem.0.004475

DMBP00003284	"Hafnia.As previously stated, a new name, Hafnia, has been introducedhere for a group of 30 of the analyzed strains. These are all Yery closelyrelated biochemically, and strains of this type seem not to have had anyspecial group name before, but to have been included under certaintypes within ""Paracolon"". Hafnia strains are rather frequent, as appears from Table 3, where it is seen that about 36 per cent of the original MK strains presumably belong to this group. Their resemblanceto Klebsiella is not much greater than to E. coli, E. freundii, etc., so itmust be justifiable to collect them in a new group. The optimum growthtemperature is 35"" C, but the strains still grow well at 40"" C. Severalreactions are, as stated, stronger or occur only at lower temperatures.VP is positive, MR negative, NH4 citrate positive, gas forniation positive, and motility positive at 22"" C. The motility is particularly critical,as a change of the incubation temperature from 38 to 36"" C makesmost of the previously non-motile strains motile in U tubes containingsemisolid agar. The ordinary fermentation reactions do not seem todiffer much at low temperatures. The HzS reaction is of the samestrength as in Proteus morganii, but much stronger than in E. coli,and it often does not occur till after some days.In addition to the reactions mentioned in Table 4, the I- and itartrate reactions have been found negative in Hafnia after 14 days.Flagella staining showed that Hafnia strains, from slide cultures keptat room temperature, are peritrichous. Apart from the types thatevidently occur in small numbers only among the strains isolated byM. Kristensen et al. (1935), the typical reactions of Hafnia are asindicated by the signs in Table 4.One of the strains recently found to have the properties of Hafniais that of ""Paratyphus alvei"", isolated by L. Bahr (1919) as pathogenicin bees, hut not in mice and guinea-pigs. The strain was analyzed byKauffmaiin & Silberstein (1937) and was found not to belong to thegenus of Salmonella. Owing to its early isolation this strain oughtpresumably to be regarded as the type species of Hafnia, under thename of Hafnia aluei, for instance.Another Hafnia strain is B. cadaveris N.C.T.C. 6578, originallyused by Gale & Epps (1944) for preparation of pure lysine decarboxylase. It differs somewhat, however, by not fermenting arabinose, andby being non-motile.The most common decarboxylase distribution within Hafnia is thatof a very strong lysine decarboxylase, a weak or no arginine decar- boxylase, a strong ornithine decarboxylase, and no glutamic acid decarboxylase. Rare exceptions are found, however, with a rather strongarginine decarboxylase or with a weak glutamic acid decarboxylase. 10.1111/j.1699-0463.1954.tb00869.x"

The strain was oxidase and catalase positive. The strain grew optimally at pH 10, NaCl concentration of 3.5% at 37°C. The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, anteiso-C15:0, and iso-C17:0.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain MEB199T belonged to the family Bacillaceae and exhibited a distinctive position among the members of the genus Alkalihalobacillus (Ahb.). Strain MEB199T shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Alkalihalobacillus alkalinitrilicus ANL-iso4T (98.36%), whereas with type species Ahb. alcalophilus DSM 485T, it is 94.91%, indicating that strain MEB199T is distinctly related to the genus Alkalihalobacillus. The G + C content of genomic DNA was 36.47 mol%. The digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) (23.6%) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) (81%) values between strain MEB199T and Ahb. alkalinitrilicus ANL-iso4T confirmed the novelty of this new species. The pairwise identity based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence between the species of genus Alkalihalobacillus ranges from 87.4 to 99.81% indicating the heterogeneity in the genus.

H pylori organisms are microaerophilic, nonsporulating, Gram-negative curved rods, 3.5 μm long and 0.5 to 1 μm wide, with a spiral periodicity in fresh cultures and spherical (coccoid) forms present in older cultures. H pylori further differs from Campylobacter species in having multiple polar sheathed flagellae (Figure 23-6), a unique composition of cell wall fatty acids, and a smooth surface. Most Campylobacter species contain either unipolar or bipolar single unsheathed flagellae and have a wrinkled surface. Unlike most campylobacters, H pylori produces urease and does not grow when incubated below 30°C. Growth is best on chocolate or blood agar plates after incubation for 2 to 5 days; for liquid media, either a blood or a hemin source appears essential.

Colonies on 2% glucose-peptone agar are mucoid(not in 2% sucrose-peptone agar). No pigments are produced.Cells do not produce H,S. There is no hydrolysis of gelatin,starch, and Tween 80. Most strains reduce nitrate to nitrite.Denitrification is negative. Growth occurs at 40°C; the optimaltemperature for growth is 30°C. Auxanographic differencesfrom the other Herbaspirillum species are given in Table 2.Acid is produced from glucose, fructose, galactose, arabinose, mannitol, lactose, glycerol, and sorbitol. No acid is produced from sucrose, raffinose, salicin, maltose, cellobiose, ormeso-inositol. Cells do fix N, as efficiently as H. seropedicae.The organism causes mottled stripe disease on sugarcane,mainly on plant genotypes from regions in which high-N fertilizer applications were used. H. rubrisubalbicans has nowbeen shown to grow abundantly in nitrogen-free semisolid media, with veil-like pellicles, just as H. seropedicae does. Nitrogenase activities and efficiency in biological N, fixation are thesame as those of H. seropedicae. In contrast to this species, itsoccurrence seems limited to sugarcane, but when artificiallyinoculated by injection, red stripes are also formed on Sorghumvulgare and Pennisetum purpureum (29). It also could be reisolated from these plants. The optimal growth temperature is30""C, in contrast to 34°C for H. seropedicae.The G+C content of the DNA is 62 to 63%.The type strain is NCPPB 1027=LMG 2286. Its G+C content is 62.5%.Herbaspirillum species 3 combines isolates from various different origins with high levels of DNA relatedness amongthem, but it is clearly distinguishable from the two speciesdescribed and is unable to fix dinitrogen.

DMBP00003308	AbstractTwo Gram-positive bacterial strains, CM2104(T) and CM2110, isolated from the inner part of abnormally spoiled oriental melon (Cucumis melo) in Korea, were subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strains CM2104(T) and CM2110 contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The predominant menaquinone was MK-8(H(4)). The major fatty acids detected in the two strains were iso-C(16 : 0), C(17 : 1)omega8c and C(18 : 1)omega9c or C(17 : 0). The DNA G+C content of the two strains was 73 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the strains formed a coherent cluster with a clade comprising two Janibacter species, Janibacter limosus and Janibacter terrae. Strains CM2104(T) and CM2110 exhibited a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity value of 99.7 % and a mean DNA-DNA relatedness level of 89 %. Strains CM2104(T) and CM2110 showed 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity levels of 97.8-98.4 % to the type strains of J. limosus and J. terrae. DNA-DNA relatedness between strains CM2104(T) and CM2110 and the type strains of these two Janibacter species was 7-11 %. On the basis of the phenotypic and phylogenetic data and genomic distinctiveness, strains CM2104(T) and CM2110 should be placed within the genus Janibacter as members of a novel species, for which the name Janibacter melonis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CM2104(T) (=KCTC 9987(T)=DSM 16063(T)=JCM 12321(T)).10.1099/ijs.0.63167-0

DMBP00003395	AbstractIn total 14 strains of Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped bacteria were isolated from Sophora longicarinata and Sophora microphylla root nodules and authenticated as rhizobia on these hosts. Based on the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, they were shown to belong to the genus Mesorhizobium, and the strains from S. longicarinata were most closely related to Mesorhizobium amorphae ACCC 19665T (99.8–99.9 %), Mesorhizobium huakuii IAM 14158T (99.8–99.9 %), Mesorhizobium loti USDA 3471T (99.5–99.9 %) and Mesorhizobium septentrionale SDW 014T (99.6–99.8 %), whilst the strains from S. microphylla were most closely related to Mesorhizobium ciceri UPM-Ca7T (99.8–99.9 %), Mesorhizobium qingshengii CCBAU 33460T (99.7 %) and Mesorhizobium shangrilense CCBAU 65327T (99.6 %). Additionally, these strains formed two distinct groups in phylogenetic trees of the housekeeping genes glnII, recA and rpoB. Chemotaxonomic data, including fatty acid profiles, supported the assignment of the strains to the genus Mesorhizobium and allowed differentiation from the closest neighbours. Results of DNA–DNA hybridizations, MALDI-TOF MS analysis, ERIC-PCR, and physiological and biochemical tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of our strains from their closest neighbouring species. Therefore, the strains isolated from S. longicarinata and S. microphylla represent two novel species for which the names Mesorhizobium waimense sp. nov. (ICMP 19557T = LMG 28228T = HAMBI 3608T) and Mesorhizobium cantuariense sp. nov. (ICMP 19515T = LMG 28225T = HAMBI 3604T), are proposed respectively.10.1099/ijsem.0.000430
DMBP00003397	AbstractThe genus Bacillus, harbouring 293 species/subspecies, constitutes a phylogenetically incoherent group. In the absence of reliable means for grouping known Bacillus species into distinct clades, restricting the placement of new species into this genus has proven difficult. To clarify the evolutionary relationships among Bacillus species, 352 available genome sequences from the family Bacillaceae were used to perform comprehensive phylogenomic and comparative genomic analyses. Four phylogenetic trees were reconstructed based on multiple datasets of proteins including 1172 core Bacillaceae proteins, 87 proteins conserved within the phylum Firmicutes, GyrA-GyrB-RpoB-RpoC proteins, and UvrD-PolA proteins. All trees exhibited nearly identical branching of Bacillus species and consistently displayed six novel monophyletic clades encompassing 5-23 Bacillus species (denoted as the Simplex, Firmus, Jeotgali, Niacini, Fastidiosus and Alcalophilus clades), interspersed with other Bacillaceae species. Species from these clades also generally grouped together in 16S rRNA gene trees. In parallel, our comparative genomic analyses of Bacillus species led to the identification of 36 molecular markers comprising conserved signature indels in protein sequences that are specifically shared by the species from these six observed clades, thus reliably demarcating these clades based on multiple molecular synapomorphies. Based on the strong evidence from multiple lines of investigations supporting the existence of these six distinct 'Bacillus' clades, we propose the transfer of species from these clades into six novel Bacillaceae genera viz. Peribacillus gen. nov., Cytobacillus gen. nov., Mesobacillus gen. nov., Neobacillus gen. nov., Metabacillus gen. nov. and Alkalihalobacillus gen. nov. These results represent an important step towards clarifying the phylogeny/taxonomy of the genus Bacillus.10.1099/ijsem.0.003775

DMBP00003585	AbstractStrain TUM18999T was isolated from the skin of a patient with burn wounds in Japan. The strain was successfully cultured at 20-42 °C (optimum, 30-35 °C) in 1.0-4.0% NaCl (w/v) and at pH 5.5-9.5, optimum pH 5.5-8.5. The phylogenetic tree reconstructed using 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD gene sequences indicated that strain TUM18999T is closely related to Pseudomonas otitidis MCC10330T. Although the partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (1412 bp) of TUM18999T exhibits high similarity to those of Pseudomonas alcaligenes NBRC 14159T (99.08 %) and Pseudomonas otitidis MCC10330T (98.51 %), multi-locus sequence analysis using 16S rRNA, gyrB, rpoB and rpoD genes reveals a clear distinction between TUM18999T and other Pseudomonas species. In addition, an average nucleotide identity >90 % was not observed in the P. aeruginosa group. Moreover, TUM18999T and P. otitidis can be distinguished based on the minimum inhibitory concentration for carbapenem. Meanwhile, the cellular fatty acids are enriched with C18 : 1 ω7c/C18 : 1 ω6c (34.35 %), C16 : 1 ω7c/C16 : 1 ω6c (24.22 %), C16 : 0 (19.79 %) and C12 : 0 (8.25 %). Based on this evidence, strain TUM18999T can be defined as representing a novel Pseudomonas species, with the proposed name Pseudomonas tohonis sp. nov. The type strain is TUM18999T (GTC 22698T=NCTC 14580T).Keywords: Pseudomonas tohonis; average nucleotide identity; gyrB; multi-locus sequence analysis; subclass B3 metallo-β-lactamase.10.1099/ijsem.0.005115

DMBP00003937	AbstractA bacterial strain named IB1.1T was isolated in a screening of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria from oil-contaminated soils on the territory of the Turukhansk District of Krasnoyarsk Krai, East Siberia, Russia. The 16S rRNA gene sequence had 98.7 % identity with respect to the closest phylogenetic relative, Pseudomonas granadensis F-278,770T, and the next most closely related species with 98.6 % similarity was Pseudomonaspunonensis, suggesting that IB1.1T should be classified within the genus Pseudomonas. The analysis of housekeeping genes rpoB, rpoD and gyrB showed similarities lower than 90 % in all cases with respect to the closest relatives, confirming its phylogenetic affiliation. The strain showed a polar flagellum. The respiratory quinone was Q9. The major fatty acids were 16 : 1ω7c/16 : 1ω6c (summed feature 3), 18 : 1ω7c and 16 : 0. The strain was oxidase- and catalase-positive, but the arginine dihydrolase system was not present. Nitrate reduction, urease and β-galactosidase production, and aesculin hydrolysis were negative. The temperature range for growth was 4-34 °C, and the strain could grow at pH 11. The DNA G+C content was 58.5 mol%. DNA-DNA hybridization results showed values of less than 30 % relatedness with respect to the type strains of the eight most closely related species. Therefore, the dataset of genotypic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data support the classification of strain IB1.1T into a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonasturukhanskensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IB1.1T (=VKM B-2935T=CECT 9091T).10.1099/ijsem.0.001406

M.L. n. elkanii of G.H. Elkan.Most characteristics are as described for the genus and as indicated in Table 2. Unlike B. japonicum, B. elkanii readily fixes nitrogen ex planta, strains generally produce indole acetic acid in liquid or broth cultures, they produce at least some growth on TY medium, and they generally grow at 34∘C or higher temperatures. Strains are better established in the southeastern United States than the rest of the country.Whole cell fatty acid content is 0.5% C16:1, 11.1% C16:0, 0.8%C17:0 cyclo, 24.7% C19:0 cyclo, and 62.3% C18:1, when grown on A1EG agar medium at 30∘C for 6 days. Like B. japonicum, it is resistant to trimethoprim at 50 mg/l and to vancomycin at 100 mg/l. Unlike B. japonicum, B. elkanii is resistant to nalidixic acid (50 mg/l), tetracycline (100 mg/l), streptomycin (100 mg/l), erythromycin (250 mg/l), chloramphenicol (500 mg/l), rifampicin (500 mg/l), and carbenicillin (500 mg/l). The exocellular polysaccharide contains rhamnose and 4-o-methyl-glucuronic acid. Cells lack nitrite reductase activity but can possess the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite. The species normally causes the formation of root nodules on species of Glycine (soybean), non-nodulating rj1rj1 soybean,black-eyed peas (Vigna), mungbean, and on Macroptiliumatropurpureum (siratro). Unlike B. japonicum, B. elkanii oftenproduces rhizobitoxine-induced chlorosis on sensitive soybean cultivars (Devine et al., 1988; 1990). Strains often arehydrogenase positive on Vigna but not Glycine, suggestingmore symbiotic affinity or compatibility with the former thanthe latter. B. elkanii may have originated on a continent otherthan Asia, where B. japonicum originates. Bottomley et al.(1994) used multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirmthe genetically distinct lineages of B. japonicum and B. elkanii.The data of Barrera et al. (1997) indicate that many MexicanLupinus-nodulating bacteria belong to B. elkanii but some areB. japonicum.The mol% G+C of the DNA is: 61–65 (Tm).Type strain: USDA 76, ATCC 49852, DSMZ 11554.GenBank accession number (16S rRNA): U35000.10.1002/9781118960608.gbm00802

N.L. n. thetaiotaomicron a combination of the Greek letters theta, iota and omicron (relating to the morphology of vacuolated forms).Characteristics are as described for the genus and as given in Table 2, with the following additional characteristics. Cells are pleomorphic and occur singly or in pairs. Cells from blood agar plates or PY broth are smaller and more homogeneous in size and shape than cells from media with a fermentable carbohydrate. Capsules are present in some strains. Surface colonies on blood agar are punctiform, circular, entire, convex, semiopaque, whitish, soft, and shiny. Sheep blood is not hemolyzed. Hemin is either required or is highly stimulatory for growth. The major fatty acids are C15:0 anteiso, C17:0 iso 3-OH, C18:1 ω9c, and C16:0 3-OH. The genome of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 has been sequenced. The genome of Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343T contains a single circular chromosome of 6,260,361bp. The genome has large expansions of many paralogous groups of genes that encode products essential to the organism’s ability to successfully compete in the human colonic microbiota. Most notable of these is the organism’s abundant machinery for utilizing a large variety of complex polysaccharides as a source of carbon and energy. The proteome also reveals the organism’s extensive ability to adapt andregulate expression of its genes in response to the changing ecosystem. These factors suggest a highly flexible and adaptable organism that is exquisitely equipped to dominate in its challenging and competitive niche (Xu et al., 2003).Source: human feces, frequently found in human clinical specimens.DNA G+C content (mol %): 40–43 (HPLC).Type strain: ATCC 29148, CCUG 10774, CIP 104206, DSM 2079, JCM 5827, NCTC 10582, VPI 5482.Sequence accession no.

DMBP00006967	AbstractStrains of Agrobacterium genomospecies 3 (i.e., genomovar G3 of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens species complex) have been previously isolated from diverse environments, including in association with plant roots, with algae, as part of a lignocellulose degrading community, from a hospital environment, as a human opportunistic pathogen, or as reported in this study, from a surface within the International Space Station. Polyphasic taxonomic methods revealed the relationship of Agrobacterium G3 strains to other Agrobacterium spp., which supports the description of a novel species. The G3 strains tested (n = 9) were phenotypically distinguishable among the strains from other genomospecies of the genus Agrobacterium. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene, gyrB gene, multi-locus sequence analysis, and 1,089-gene core-genome gene concatenate concur that tested G3 strains belong to the Agrobacterium genus and they form a clade distinct from other validly described Agrobacterium species. The distinctiveness of this clade was confirmed by average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) comparisons between the G3 tested strains and all known Agrobacterium species type strains, since obtained values were considerably below the 95% (ANI) and 70% (dDDH) thresholds used for the species delineation. According to the core-genome phylogeny and ANI comparisons, the closest relatives of G3 strains were Agrobacterium sp. strains UGM030330-04 and K599, members of a novel genomospecies we propose to call genomovar G21. Using this polyphasic approach, we characterized the phenotypic and genotypic synapomorphies of Agrobacterium G3, showing it is a bona fide bacterial species, well separated from previously named Agrobacterium species or other recognized genomic species. We thus propose the name Agrobacterium tomkonis for this species previously referred to as Agrobacterium genomospecies 3. The type strain of A. tomkonis is IIF1SW-B1T (= LMG 32164 = NRRL B-65602). Comparative genomic analysis show A. tomkonis strains have species-specific genes associated with secretion of secondary metabolites, including an exopolysaccharide and putative adhesins and resistance to copper. A. tomkonis specific gene functions notably relate to surface adhesion and could be involved to colonize nutrient-poor and harsh habitats. The A. tomkonis strains from the ISS showed presence of a 40-kbp plasmid and several other potential mobile genetic elements detected that could also be part of conjugative elements or integrated prophages.Keywords: Agrobacterium tomkonis; ISS; MLSA; genomovar G3; metagenomics; phylogenomics.Copyright © 2021 Singh, Lavire, Nesme, Vial, Nesme, Mason, Lassalle and Venkateswaran.10.3389/fmicb.2021.765943
